  {"id":"alexanderssonAnalysisRollDamping2021","abstract":"Having an accurate prediction of ship roll damping is crucial when analysing roll motions. In this paper, the simplified Ikeda method (SI-method) is compared with the original Ikeda method. The methods are compared using results from a database of roll decay tests carried out on modern merchant ships and a smaller set of predictions in which the original Ikeda method was used. It was found that most of the ships in the database had dimensions outside the limits of the SI-method. Thus, the SI-method showed poor agreement with model tests outside its limits but acceptable agreement for ships within limits. It was found that the deviations were caused by extrapolation errors of the wave-damping in the SI-method. Two ways to improve the accuracy of the SI-method were proposed based on regression, which gave about the same accuracy as the original Ikeda method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Alexandersson","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Mao","given":"Wengang"},{"family":"Ringsberg","given":"Jonas W."}],"citation-key":"alexanderssonAnalysisRollDamping2021","container-title":"Ships and Offshore Structures","DOI":"10.1080/17445302.2021.1907070","ISSN":"1744-5302","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,13]]},"page":"1-8","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Analysis of roll damping model scale data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17445302.2021.1907070","volume":"0"},

In this study, the capability of two recognised manoeuvrability models to predict ships’ trajectories is investigated based on both simulation and open-water experiment test data. The parameters of these models are estimated by a statistical learning method. The goodness of the two estimated models for describing a merchant ship’s manoeuvrability is first studied using her manoeuvring simulation data. Then, experimental manoeuvring tests to use a USV in open water with wind and drifting effects are used to check the conventional model identification procedures.

Potential flow-based analysis presents such a solution for seakeeping analyses. The accuracy of roll motion in potential flow is however not so good, due to the large influence from vicsous roll damping, which is missing in these calculations. This paper proposes a hybrid method, as a solution to this problem , where the viscous roll damping from Ikeda's semi-empirical method is injected into an existing 3D unsteady fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) method.

The present methods, most of them\ndeveloped during the 1970s, give reasonable results for head waves. But for quartering and following\nwaves, the methods have low accuracy, due to uncertainties in strip calculated ship motions for these\ncases, and the ability to account for roll and yaw motions.\nIn this thesis Gerristma and Beukelman’s method and Boese’s method to calculate added resistance is\nimplemented and validated against published calculation results, from previous implementations. The\nimplementations are also evaluated against published experimental results in head waves. These\nevaluations show that added resistance with good accuracy can be calculated for head waves using\nGerritsma and Beukelman’s method.\nThis thesis also shows how a simplified method to calculate added resistance in waves can be developed.\nThis simplified method only uses the ships main particulars to describe the hull. The method is intended\nto be used when the entire hull geometry is not available, for instance in the pre-study of a new ship\ndesign. The idea with this method is to estimate transfer functions for added resistance without using strip\ncalculations. The transfer functions are parameterized with three parameters, peak value, peak frequency\nand spreading. Expressions for these parameters are derived with regression analysis, based on analytical\nresults from Gerritsma and Beukelman’s method.

A majority of the publications in this field are based on simulated data. In this paper model test data is used. The identification process can be decomposed into finding a suitable manoeuvring model for the hydrodynamic forces and to correctly handle errors from the measurement noise. A parameter estimation is proposed to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives. The most suitable manoeuvring model is found using the parameter estimation with cross-validation on a set of competing manoeuvring models. The parameter estimation uses inverse dynamics regression and Extended Kalman filter (EKF) with a Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother. Two case study vessels, wPCC and KVLCC2, with very different maneuverability characteristics are used to demonstrate and validate the proposed method.

  {"id":"alexanderssonTHESISDEGREELICENTIATE2022","abstract":"It is common today that operational data is recorded onboard ships within the Internet\nof Ships (IoS) paradigm. This enables the possibility to build ship digital twins as\ndigital copies of the real ships. Predicting the ship’s motions with ship dynamics could\nbe an important sub-component of these ship digital twins. A model for the ship’s\ndynamics can be identified based on observations of the ship’s motions. The identified\nmodel will have model uncertainty due to imperfections and idealizations made in\nphysical model formulations as well as uncertainty from errors in the measurement\ndata, which can be very pronounced when using full scale operational data. It is\neasier to develop accurate models with low model uncertainty using data obtained in\na controlled laboratory environment where the measurement errors are much lower,\nespecially in calm water conditions. The prediction model should be able to describe\nscenarios that a ship has never encountered before, which is possible if much of the\nunderlying physics has been identified. Grey-box modelling is a technique which\ncombines operational data with physical principles to achieve this.\nThe objective of this thesis is to develop system identification methods for grey\nbox models with good generalization of the model scale rigid body ship dynamics in\ncalm waters.\nA model development procedure is proposed to handle the model uncertainty\nthrough the selection of candidate models based on a hold-out evaluation procedure.\nThe measurement noise is handled by an iterative preprocessor, which uses an extended\nKalman filter (EKF) and a Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother that uses an initially\nestimated predictor model from semi-empirical formulas.\nIt is demonstrated that the ship’s roll motion with high accuracy can be described\nusing a quadratic damping model.

  {"id":"faberInverseDynamicsMechanical2018","abstract":"Inverse dynamics is a technique in which measured kinematics and, possibly, external forces are used to calculate net joint torques in a rigid body linked segment model. However, kinematics and forces are usually not consistent due to incorrect modelling assumptions and measurement errors. This is commonly resolved by introducing ‘residual forces and torques’ which compensate for this problem, but do not exist in reality. In this study a constrained optimization algorithm is proposed that finds the kinematics that are mechanically consistent with measured external forces and mimic the measured kinematics as closely as possible. The algorithm was tested on datasets containing planar kinematics and ground reaction forces obtained during human walking at three velocities (0.8 m/s, 1.25 and 1.8 m/s). Before optimization, the residual force and torque were calculated for a typical example. Both showed substantial values, indicating the necessity of developing a mechanically consistent algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm converged to a solution in which the residual forces and torques were zero, without changing the ground reaction forces and with only minor changes to the measured kinematics. When using a rigid body approach, our algorithm ensures a consistent description of forces and kinematics, thereby improving the validity of calculated net joint torque and power values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Faber","given":"Herre"},{"family":"Soest","given":"Arthur J.","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Kistemaker","given":"Dinant A."}],"citation-key":"faberInverseDynamicsMechanical2018","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0204575","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e0204575","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Inverse dynamics of mechanical multibody systems: An improved algorithm that ensures consistency between kinematics and external forces","title-short":"Inverse dynamics of mechanical multibody systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204575","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"kjellbergSailingPerformanceWindPowered2023","abstract":"The need to reduce green-house gas emissions from shipping has reborn the interest in wind propulsion for commercial cargo vessels. This places new requirements on the tools used in ship design, as well as the methods usually applied in sailing yacht design. A range of design tools are used by designers at various stages in the design of wind-assisted ships and for different purposes. One important tool is the steady-state velocity prediction program (VPP) which is typically used to predict the speed of the vessel when sailing in a range of wind directions and wind speeds. Steady-state VPPs can be very efficient and fast and may be used to rapidly assess a large number of design alternatives. However, steady-state VPPs are not able to consider dynamic effects such as unsteady wave forces on the hull which may require the rudder to be active to control the heading and course of the vessel. This, in turn, leads to different mean forces than those predicted by a static VPP and therefore the sailing performance may be reduced compared to the predictions of a static VPP. Another effect of the ship’s motions in a seaway is that the angles of attack of the sails fluctuate, which can lead to different optimum sheeting angles and possibly a loss of performance. This study uses an unsteady 3D fully nonlinear potential flow hydrodynamic model coupled with an efficient lifting-line aerodynamic model to investigate the differences in sailing performance of a vessel sailing in steady conditions to the performance when sailing in a seaway and gusty wind based on a spatio-temporal wind model. The analysis shows clearly that the unsteady wind model affects the predicted performance. This is especially the case when sailing close-hauled and on a beam reach, where large changes in the local sail angles of attack can be observed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kjellberg","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Gerhardt","given":"Frederik"},{"family":"Werner","given":"Sofia"}],"citation-key":"kjellbergSailingPerformanceWindPowered2023","container-title":"Journal of Sailing Technology","container-title-short":"Journal of Sailing Technology","DOI":"10.5957/jst/2023.8.12.218","ISSN":"2475-370X","issue":"01","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,31]]},"page":"218-254","source":"Silverchair","title":"Sailing Performance of Wind-Powered Cargo Vessel in Unsteady Conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.5957/jst/2023.8.12.218","volume":"8"},

Accurate and efficient simulation models are needed to achieve maximum energy efficiency. In this paper a grey-box modeling approach for the simulation of ocean vessels is presented. The modeling approach combines conventional analysis models based on physical principles (a white-box model) with a feed forward neural-network (a black-box model). Two different ways of combining these models are presented, in series and in parallel. The results of simulating several trips of a medium sized container vessel show that the grey-box modeling approach, both serial and parallel approaches, can improve the prediction of the vessel fuel consumption significantly compared to a white-box model. However, a prediction of the vessel speed is only improved slightly. Furthermore, the results give an indication of the potential advantages of grey-box models, which is extrapolation beyond a given training data set and the incorporation of physical phenomena which are not modeled in the white-box models. Finally, included is a discussion on how to enhance the predictability of the grey-box models as well as updating the neural-network in real-time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Leifsson","given":"Leifur Þ."},{"family":"Sævarsdóttir","given":"Hildur"},{"family":"Sigurðsson","given":"Sven Þ."},{"family":"Vésteinsson","given":"Ari"}],"citation-key":"leifssonGreyboxModelingOcean2008","collection-title":"EUROSIM 2007","container-title":"Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory","container-title-short":"Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory","DOI":"10.1016/j.simpat.2008.03.006","ISSN":"1569-190X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"923-932","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Grey-box modeling of an ocean vessel for operational optimization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569190X08000488","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"liShipManeuverabilityModeling2022","abstract":"To obtain an accurate ship maneuverability model for motion prediction and autonomous navigation, a ship maneuverability modeling and numerical prediction method is proposed based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A Mathematical Model Group (MMG) model is utilized to describe the ship maneuverability with data from virtual captive model and free-running tests. Static Oblique Towing Test (OTT) and dynamic Circular Motion Test (CMT) are both performed to acquire necessary data for the MMG model identification. The forces and moments acting on ship hull are predicted by solving unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. The MMG hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained with the results of captive model tests. In the free-running simulations, to reduce the computational cost of considerable propeller grids, a body force propeller method is introduced to provide thrust forces directly, and the ship motion is handled by overset grids of ship hull and rudder. A 3-degree of freedom MMG model is identified with numerical simulation results, i.e., the self-propulsion test, rudder angle 35°turning test and 15/1 zig-zag test, for a standard KRISO Container Ship (KCS). These tests show that the motion prediction and free-running maneuvering results can agree with the standard experimental data well. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"S."},{"family":"Liu","given":"C."},{"family":"Chu","given":"X."},{"family":"Zheng","given":"M."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Z."},{"family":"Kan","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"liShipManeuverabilityModeling2022","container-title":"Ocean Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.112454","ISSN":"0029-8018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"English","source":"Scopus","title":"Ship maneuverability modeling and numerical prediction using CFD with body force propeller","type":"article-journal","volume":"264"},
  {"id":"liuPredictionsShipManeuverability2018","abstract":"Maneuverability is an important hydrodynamic performance of a ship, and should be taken into account during the ship design stage. The present study of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations aims to offer a numerical tool for maneuvering prediction with high accuracy. The virtual captive model tests for a model scale KCS container ship are conducted using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computation to obtain the full set of linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives in the 3rd-order Abkowitz model. The numerical uncertainty analysis is carried out for the pure sway and yaw-drift tests to verify the numerical accuracy. It is concluded that the lower order Fourier coefficients are preferred in the computation of the hydrodynamic derivatives. Moreover, part of the computed hydrodynamic forces and moments are compared with the available captive model test data, and good agreement is obtained. By substituting the computed hydrodynamic derivatives into the mathematical model, the standard turning and zigzag maneuvers are predicted. By comparing the predicted maneuvering results with the available experimental data and the prediction results by others, it is demonstrated that acceptable prediction accuracy can be achieved with the present method, which shows the effectiveness of the present method in predicting ship maneuverability. © 2018 The Author(s).","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Y."},{"family":"Zou","given":"L."},{"family":"Zou","given":"Z."},{"family":"Guoa","given":"H."}],"citation-key":"liuPredictionsShipManeuverability2018","container-title":"Engineering Applications of Computational Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1080/19942060.2018.1439773","ISSN":"1994-2060","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"English","page":"334-353","source":"Scopus","title":"Predictions of ship maneuverability based on virtual captive model tests","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"ljungPerspectivesSystemIdentification2010","abstract":"System identification is the art and science of building mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input–output data. It can be seen as the interface between the real world of applications and the mathematical world of control theory and model abstractions. As such, it is an ubiquitous necessity for successful applications. System identification is a very large topic, with different techniques that depend on the character of the models to be estimated: linear, nonlinear, hybrid, nonparametric, etc. At the same time, the area can be characterized by a small number of leading principles, e.g. to look for sustainable descriptions by proper decisions in the triangle of model complexity, information contents in the data, and effective validation. The area has many facets and there are many approaches and methods. A tutorial or a survey in a few pages is not quite possible. Instead, this presentation aims at giving an overview of the “science” side, i.e. basic principles and results and at pointing to open problem areas in the practical, “art”, side of how to approach and solve a real problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ljung","given":"Lennart"}],"citation-key":"ljungPerspectivesSystemIdentification2010","container-title":"Annual Reviews in Control","container-title-short":"Annual Reviews in Control","DOI":"10.1016/j.arcontrol.2009.12.001","ISSN":"1367-5788","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",4,1]]},"page":"1-12","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Perspectives on system identification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367578810000027","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"marimongiovannettiEffectsHydrodynamicForces2020","abstract":"Assessing the manoeuvring performances of a ship at a design stage is becoming more important, especially when trying to improve shipping efficiency to reduce fuel consumption.\nWhen designing a hull with appendages, it is necessary to balance hydrodynamic efficiency with manoeuvrability. Therefore, the possibility of simulating a captive test at a design stage will increase the chances of understanding the behaviour of a ship from an early stage in the design process. The current research is based on the evaluation of hydrodynamic efficiency of a hull and appendages in a pure resistance, self-propulsion and in a wind-assisted mode.\nThe forces and moments acting on the hull and appendages are then analysed and used as inputs for a Virtual Captive Test (VCT) [1]. In order to correctly perform a VCT and further analyse the performances of a ship with a Velocity Prediction Programme (VPP), particular care has been put in correctly capturing the manoeuvrability coefficients. Those are derived with polynomial fittings once the forces and moments acting on the ship are extracted from the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.\nMany CFD simulations were performed to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hull and appendages in a range of flow directions, rudder angles and rotating flow. Those simulations encompass the whole range of datapoints needed to describe a wind-assisted ship during manoeuvring.\nTaking into consideration both hydrodynamic characteristics and manoeuvrability effects at an early design stage can reduce model tests costs and will allow to inspect a larger number of hull-appendages scenarios when analysing the final VPP results.","author":[{"family":"Marimon Giovannetti","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Olsson","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Alexandersson","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Werner","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Finnsgård","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"marimongiovannettiEffectsHydrodynamicForces2020","DOI":"10.1115/OMAE2020-18673","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,3]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"The Effects of Hydrodynamic Forces on Maneuvrability Coefficients for Wind-Assisted Ships","type":"book"},

  {"id":"villaNumericalAnalysisRudder2020","abstract":"The proper evaluation of the Rudder–Propeller interactions is mandatory to correctly predict the manoeuvring capability of a modern ship, in particular considering the commonly adopted ship layout (rudder often works in the propeller slipstream). Modern Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers can provide, not only the performance of the whole system but also an insight into the flow problem. In the present paper, an open-source viscous flow solver has been validated against available literature experimental measurements in different conditions. After an extensive analysis of the numerical influence of the mesh arrangement and the turbulent quantities on the rudder provided forces, the study focused its attention on the forces generated by the rudder varying the propeller loading conditions and the mutual position between the two devices. These analyses give a hint to describe and improve a commonly-used semi-empirical method based on the actuator disk theory. These analyses also demonstrate the ability of these numerical approaches to correctly predict the interaction behaviour in pre-stall conditions with quite reasonable computational requests (proper also for a design stage), giving additional information on the sectional forces distribution along the span-wise rudder direction, useful to further develop a new semi-empirical rudder model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Villa","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Franceschi","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Viviani","given":"Michele"}],"citation-key":"villaNumericalAnalysisRudder2020","container-title":"Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","DOI":"10.3390/jmse8120990","ISSN":"2077-1312","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"12","page":"990","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Numerical Analysis of the Rudder–Propeller Interaction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/8/12/990","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"yasukawaIntroductionMMGStandard2015","abstract":"A lot of simulation methods based on Maneuvering Modeling Group (MMG) model for ship maneuvering have been presented. Many simulation methods sometimes harm the adaptability of hydrodynamic force data for the maneuvering simulations since one method may be not applicable to other method in general. To avoid this, basic part of the method should be common. Under such a background, research committee on “standardization of mathematical model for ship maneuvering predictions” was organized by the Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers and proposed a prototype of maneuvering prediction method for ships, called “MMG standard method”. In this article, the MMG standard method is introduced. The MMG standard method is composed of 4 elements; maneuvering simulation model, procedure of the required captive model tests to capture the hydrodynamic force characteristics, analysis method for determining the hydrodynamic force coefficients for maneuvering simulations, and prediction method for maneuvering motions of a ship in fullscale. KVLCC2 tanker is selected as a sample ship and the captive mode test results are presented with a process of the data analysis. Using the hydrodynamic force coefficients presented, maneuvering simulations are carried out for KVLCC2 model and the fullscale ship for validation of the method. The present method can roughly capture the maneuvering motions and is useful for the maneuvering predictions in fullscale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Yasukawa","given":"H."},{"family":"Yoshimura","given":"Y."}],"citation-key":"yasukawaIntroductionMMGStandard2015","container-title":"Journal of Marine Science and Technology","container-title-short":"J Mar Sci Technol","DOI":"10.1007/s00773-014-0293-y","ISSN":"1437-8213","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"37-52","source":"Springer Link","title":"Introduction of MMG standard method for ship maneuvering predictions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00773-014-0293-y","volume":"20"}
