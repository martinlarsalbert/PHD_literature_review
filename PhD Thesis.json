  {"id":"alexanderssonAnalysisRollDamping2021","abstract":"Having an accurate prediction of ship roll damping is crucial when analysing roll motions. In this paper, the simplified Ikeda method (SI-method) is compared with the original Ikeda method. The methods are compared using results from a database of roll decay tests carried out on modern merchant ships and a smaller set of predictions in which the original Ikeda method was used. It was found that most of the ships in the database had dimensions outside the limits of the SI-method. Thus, the SI-method showed poor agreement with model tests outside its limits but acceptable agreement for ships within limits. It was found that the deviations were caused by extrapolation errors of the wave-damping in the SI-method. Two ways to improve the accuracy of the SI-method were proposed based on regression, which gave about the same accuracy as the original Ikeda method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Alexandersson","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Mao","given":"Wengang"},{"family":"Ringsberg","given":"Jonas W."}],"citation-key":"alexanderssonAnalysisRollDamping2021","container-title":"Ships and Offshore Structures","DOI":"10.1080/17445302.2021.1907070","ISSN":"1744-5302","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,13]]},"page":"1-8","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Analysis of roll damping model scale data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17445302.2021.1907070","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"alexanderssonPredictionRollMotion","abstract":"Getting the best possible accuracy with the lowest possible computational cost is an important factor in the early design stage of ships. Potential ﬂow-based analysis presents such a solution for seakeeping analyses. The accuracy of roll motion in potential ﬂow is however not so good, due to the large inﬂuence from vicsous roll damping, which is missing in these calculations. This paper proposes a hybrid method, as a solution to this problem, where the viscous roll damping from Ikeda’s semi-empirical method is injected into an existing 3D unsteady fully nonlinear potential ﬂow (FNPF) method.

Potential flow-based analysis presents such a solution for seakeeping analyses. The accuracy of roll motion in potential flow is however not so good, due to the large influence from vicsous roll damping, which is missing in these calculations. This paper proposes a hybrid method, as a solution to this problem , where the viscous roll damping from Ikeda's semi-empirical method is injected into an existing 3D unsteady fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) method.

  {"id":"alexanderssonSTUDYMETHODSPREDICT2009","abstract":"This thesis is an overview of added resistance in waves, available methods and how a simplified method\ncan be developed.\nAdded resistance in waves is indeed a very complicated problem. The present methods, most of them\ndeveloped during the 1970s, give reasonable results for head waves. But for quartering and following\nwaves, the methods have low accuracy, due to uncertainties in strip calculated ship motions for these\ncases, and the ability to account for roll and yaw motions.\nIn this thesis Gerristma and Beukelman’s method and Boese’s method to calculate added resistance is\nimplemented and validated against published calculation results, from previous implementations. The\nimplementations are also evaluated against published experimental results in head waves. These\nevaluations show that added resistance with good accuracy can be calculated for head waves using\nGerritsma and Beukelman’s method.\nThis thesis also shows how a simplified method to calculate added resistance in waves can be developed.\nThis simplified method only uses the ships main particulars to describe the hull. The method is intended\nto be used when the entire hull geometry is not available, for instance in the pre-study of a new ship\ndesign. The idea with this method is to estimate transfer functions for added resistance without using strip\ncalculations. The transfer functions are parameterized with three parameters, peak value, peak frequency\nand spreading. Expressions for these parameters are derived with regression analysis, based on analytical\nresults from Gerritsma and Beukelman’s method. The simplified method has an accuracy of about 25%,\nwhich is about the same amount that usually can be expected of a method to calculate added resistance in\nwaves.","author":[{"family":"Alexandersson","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"alexanderssonSTUDYMETHODSPREDICT2009","DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.2.18796.69767","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"A STUDY OF METHODS TO PREDICT ADDED RESISTANCE IN WAVES","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"alexanderssonTHESISDEGREELICENTIATE2022","abstract":"It is common today that operational data is recorded onboard ships within the Internet\nof Ships (IoS) paradigm. This enables the possibility to build ship digital twins as\ndigital copies of the real ships. Predicting the ship’s motions with ship dynamics could\nbe an important sub-component of these ship digital twins. A model for the ship’s\ndynamics can be identified based on observations of the ship’s motions. The identified\nmodel will have model uncertainty due to imperfections and idealizations made in\nphysical model formulations as well as uncertainty from errors in the measurement\ndata, which can be very pronounced when using full scale operational data. It is\neasier to develop accurate models with low model uncertainty using data obtained in\na controlled laboratory environment where the measurement errors are much lower,\nespecially in calm water conditions. The prediction model should be able to describe\nscenarios that a ship has never encountered before, which is possible if much of the\nunderlying physics has been identified. Grey-box modelling is a technique which\ncombines operational data with physical principles to achieve this.\nThe objective of this thesis is to develop system identification methods for grey\nbox models with good generalization of the model scale rigid body ship dynamics in\ncalm waters.\nA model development procedure is proposed to handle the model uncertainty\nthrough the selection of candidate models based on a hold-out evaluation procedure.\nThe measurement noise is handled by an iterative preprocessor, which uses an extended\nKalman filter (EKF) and a Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother that uses an initially\nestimated predictor model from semi-empirical formulas.\nIt is demonstrated that the ship’s roll motion with high accuracy can be described\nusing a quadratic damping model. For the more complex manoeuvring models,\nmulticollinearity is a large problem where the appropriate complexity needs to be\nselected with the bias-variance trade-off between underfitting or overfitting the data.\nHold-out turning circle tests were predicted with high accuracy for the wPCC and\nKVLCC2 test case ships with models from the proposed development procedure and\nparameter estimation method.\nThe proposed methods can produce prediction models with high generalization\ngiven that a suitable model structure has been selected from the candidate models\nand an appropriate split in the hold-out evaluation of the model development process\nhas been applied.","author":[{"family":"Alexandersson","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"alexanderssonTHESISDEGREELICENTIATE2022","DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.2.23950.02889","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"THESIS FOR THE DEGREE OF LICENTIATE OF ENGINEERING Rigid Body Ship Dynamics System Identification in Calm Waters","type":"thesis"},

Once high and dangerous roll motions are developed, especially by the ships with large flares fore and aft, as container ships, it generates accelerations in the lashing equipment that exceeds the threshold values, leading to collapse of container stows as well as loos of containers overboard. In this paper is presented the results of the analysis of a container ship roll motions in adverse weather conditions in a particular area of navigation from North Atlantic Ocean. The analysis is based on a real case scenario of a container ship casualty occurred in a very common navigation route, generated by high roll motions and resulted in the collapse of container stows and a massive loss of containers overboard. The aim of this paper is to identify the causes and analyse the factors that generated the dangerous situation and the casualty. The simulations carried out and presented in this paper were performed by using the OCTOPUS Office 6 (AMARCON) software that can reveal the response on the ship in modelled energy spectrum environmental conditions. The results will lead to a better understanding of the root causes that generated the exposure of the ship to such dangerous situation and can be used as recommendations in order to avoid similar situations in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Andrei","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Acomi","given":"Nicoleta"},{"family":"Ancuţa","given":"Cristian"}],"citation-key":"andreiRollMotionsAnalysis2018","container-title":"Advanced Topics in Optoelectronics, Microelectronics, and Nanotechnologies IX","DOI":"10.1117/12.2322704","event-title":"Advanced Topics in Optoelectronics, Microelectronics, and Nanotechnologies IX","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,31]]},"page":"109771Q","publisher":"International Society for Optics and Photonics","source":"www-spiedigitallibrary-org.proxy.lib.chalmers.se","title":"Roll motions analysis to improve ship responses in adverse weather conditions","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www-spiedigitallibrary-org.proxy.lib.chalmers.se/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10977/109771Q/Roll-motions-analysis-to-improve-ship-responses-in-adverse-weather/10.1117/12.2322704.short","volume":"10977"},

Despite its short computation time, system-based simulations need many captive model tests to estimate the hydrodynamic and rudder maneuvering coefficients used in the system-based mathematical model and the results have difficulty to achieve quantitative agreement with experimental data. Herein system identification techniques (extended Kalman filtering and constrained least square method using generalized reduced gradient algorithm) are used to predict the maneuvering coefficients from several EFD, systems based and CFD free-running trials. CFD gives not only the ship motions but also the total and component hydrodynamic forces/moments during the free-running simulations, which is helpful for estimating the maneuvering coefficients. Several types of free-running (turning circle, zigzag and large angle zigzag) tests are conducted using EFD and CFD to examine which free-running trial gives the best maneuvering coefficients using system identification. Also several free-running data are combined together for parallel processing. The set of maneuvering coefficients estimated by the constrained least square method using combined CFD free-running trial data show the most generalized results which covers a wide range of maneuvers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Araki","given":"Motoki"},{"family":"Sadat-Hosseini","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Sanada","given":"Yugo"},{"family":"Tanimoto","given":"Kenji"},{"family":"Umeda","given":"Naoya"},{"family":"Stern","given":"Frederick"}],"citation-key":"arakiEstimatingManeuveringCoefficients2012","container-title":"Ocean Engineering","container-title-short":"Ocean Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2012.05.001","ISSN":"0029-8018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"63-84","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Estimating maneuvering coefficients using system identification methods with experimental, system-based, and CFD free-running trial data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002980181200162X","volume":"51"},

A series of lake based and towing tank tests experiments have been conducted which included bollard pull, shaft efficiency, naked-hull, self-propulsion, and manoeuvrability tests. These investigated the efficiency improvement resulting from changing the ship operational trim and testing different bow designs. An associated mathematical model for the time domain simulation of the autonomous ship model provides an effective tool for data analysis. It has been demonstrated that the use of a suitably instrumented self-propelled autonomous ship model can provide long duration tests that incorporates the influence of varying environmental conditions and thereby identify marginal gains in ship energy efficiency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bassam","given":"Ameen M."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Alexander B."},{"family":"Turnock","given":"Stephen R."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Philip A."}],"citation-key":"bassamExperimentalTestingSimulations2019a","container-title":"Ocean Engineering","container-title-short":"Ocean Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.05.047","ISSN":"0029-8018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,15]]},"language":"en","page":"106065","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Experimental testing and simulations of an autonomous, self-propulsion and self-measuring tanker ship model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801818320286","volume":"186"},
  {"id":"beghiGreyboxModelingMotorcycle2007","abstract":"There is an increasing use of virtual prototyping tools in the motorcycle industry, aimed at reducing the development time of new models and speeding up performance optimization, by providing the designer with an in-laboratory virtual test track. Virtual prototyping software are multibody simulation software, which require the availability of models of all the vehicle components. The choice of the model is then of paramount importance, since it heavily affects the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results. Conventional models (like linear models) are often inadequate to describe the behavior of complex nonlinear components, so that it is necessary to appeal to different modeling approaches. This is actually the case when dealing with motorcycle suspension systems, given that their most critical part, the shock absorber, exhibits nonlinear and time-variant behavior. In this paper, a grey-box model of a racing motorcycle mono-tube shock absorber is proposed, which consists of a nonlinear parametric model and a black-box, neural-network-based model. The absorber model has been implemented in a numerical simulation environment, and validated against experimental test data. The results of the validation show that the model is able to reproduce the real behavior of the shock absorber with an accuracy that matches or even beats that of other models previously presented in the literature. The interfacing of the proposed model to the ADAMS virtual prototyping environment is also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Beghi","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Liberati","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Mezzalira","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Peron","given":"Stivi"}],"citation-key":"beghiGreyboxModelingMotorcycle2007","container-title":"Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory","container-title-short":"Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory","DOI":"10.1016/j.simpat.2007.04.011","ISSN":"1569-190X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"894-907","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Grey-box modeling of a motorcycle shock absorber for virtual prototyping applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569190X07000561","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"bulianSimplifiedModularApproach2004","abstract":"In this work a combined analytical-numerical approach is proposed to address the problem of the ship roll motion under the combined action of wind and waves. Roll motion is modelled as a one-degree-of-freedom system non-linear in both damping and restoring. The approach is modular, allowing an easy update of the methodology on the basis of new research outcomes. Realistic environmental conditions regarding the effects of both wind and waves are taken into account and can be easily changed. The spatial correlation of wind gusts is taken into account by means of an 'aerodynamic admittance' function, whereas the moment due to waves is obtained from the sea slope spectrum using the concept of effective wave slope, leading to a 'hydrodynamic admittance' function. Both static and dynamic aspects of the problems are taken into account. The proposed analytical procedure, based on statistical linearization technique, allows approximate statistical averages of the roll motion, assumed to be Gaussian, to be obtained without necessarily resorting to time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. On the basis of the results obtained, an estimation of the capsize probability can be carried out. It seems that the effect of wind gustiness could be considered very small when compared with the effects of waves and mean wind speed when the metacentric height is sufficiently large. Finally, the presented approach moves towards the concept of 'performance-based analysis', recently introduced at the International Maritime Organization as the basis for future developments of intact stability, in a clear and formal way.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Bulian","given":"G."},{"family":"Francescutto","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"bulianSimplifiedModularApproach2004","container-title":"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers Part M: Journal of Engineering for the Maritime Environment","DOI":"10.1243/1475090041737958","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"189-212","source":"Scopus","title":"A simplified modular approach for the prediction of the roll motion due to the combined action of wind and waves","type":"article-journal","volume":"218"},
  {"id":"carricaURANSAnalysisBroaching2008","abstract":"Ship motions in a high sea state can have adverse effects on controllability, cause loss of stability, and ultimately compromise the survivability of the ship. In a broaching event, the ship losses control, naturally turning broadside to the waves, causing a dangerous situation and possibly capsizing. Classical approaches to study broaching rely on costly experimental programs and/or time-domain potential or system-based simulation codes. In this paper the ability of Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) to simulate a broaching event in irregular waves is demonstrated, and the extensive information available is used to analyze the broaching process. The demonstration nature of this paper is stressed, as opposed to a validated study. Unsteady RANS (URANS) provides a model based on first principles to capture phenomena such as coupling between sway, yaw, and roll, roll damping, effects of complex waves on righting arm, rudders partially out of the water, etc. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method uses a single-phase level-set approach to model the free surface, and dynamic overset grids to resolve large-amplitude motions. Before evaluating irregular seas two regular wave cases are demonstrated, one causing broaching and one causing stable surf riding. A sea state 8 is imposed following an irregular Bretschneider spectrum, and an autopilot was implemented to control heading and speed with two different gains for the heading controller. It is concluded that the autopilot causes the ship to be in an adverse dynamic condition at the beginning of the broaching process, and thus is partially responsible for the occurrence of the broaching event. © 2008 JASNAOE.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Carrica","given":"P.M."},{"family":"Paik","given":"K.-J."},{"family":"Hosseini","given":"H.S."},{"family":"Stern","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"carricaURANSAnalysisBroaching2008","container-title":"Journal of Marine Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1007/s00773-008-0022-5","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"395-407","source":"Scopus","title":"URANS analysis of a broaching event in irregular quartering seas","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

The procedure is mainly based on a two pass algorithm called the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother, which consists of a forward pass Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a backward recursion smoother. On top of that, this paper proposes the implementation of the Wiener Type Filter prior to the RTS in order to avoid the complicated process noise covariance matrix estimation. Furthermore, an easy to implement airdata measurement noise variance estimation method is introduced. The method estimates the airdata and subsequently the noise variances using the ground speed and ascent rate provided by the Global Positioning System (GPS). It incorporates the idea of data regionality by assuming that some sort of statistical relation exists between nearby data points.

To assess the energy eﬃciency of a new ship, the regulations require to estimate the Energy Eﬃciency Design Index (EEDI), which represent the amount of Carbon Dioxide produced per mile in relation to the amount of cargo carried, and verify that it is smaller than a prescribed value. For a proper evaluation of the EEDI, it is necessary to estimate the added resistance in waves with high accuracy. There are diﬀerent ways to evaluate added resistance: empirical methods, adding a safety factor to the calm water resistance called sea margin, numerical simulations and model test experiments. Nowadays, the most used way during the design stage to do that is employing numerical simulations. Numerical simulations are not only used for the estimation of added resistance, but also to predict ship motions. If the motions are known at an early design stage, it is possible to modify the design of a ship to minimize them in order to improve the performance of the ship and to increase the safety and comfort of those who are on board.","author":[{"family":"Coslovich","given":"F"}],"citation-key":"coslovichDegreesFreedomSeakeeping","language":"en","page":"64","source":"Zotero","title":"Towards 6 Degrees of Freedom Seakeeping Simulations Using a Fully Nonlinear Potential Flow Method","type":"article-journal"},

Numerical simulations of static drift tests have been performed by a commercial RANS solver based on a finite volume method (FVM) in an unsteady manner. The fluid flow is considered as 3-D, incompressible and fully turbulent. Hydrodynamic analyses have been carried out for a fixed Froude number 0.28. During the analyses, the free surface effects have been taken into account using VOF (Volume of Fluid) method and the hull is considered as fixed. First, the code has been validated with the available experimental data in literature. After validation, static drift, static rudder and drift and rudder tests have been simulated. The forces and moments acting on the hull have been computed with URANS approach. Numerical results have been applied to determine the hydrodynamic maneuvering coefficients, such as, velocity terms and rudder terms. The acceleration, angular velocity and cross-coupled terms have been taken from the available experimental data. A computer program has been developed to apply a fast maneuvering simulation technique. Abkowitz’s non-linear mathematical model has been used to calculate the forces and moment acting on the hull during the maneuvering motion. Euler method on the other hand has been applied to solve the simultaneous differential equations. Turning and zig-zag maneuvering simulations have been carried out and the maneuvering characteristics have been determined and the numerical simulation results have been compared with the available data in literature.

  {"id":"faberInverseDynamicsMechanical2018","abstract":"Inverse dynamics is a technique in which measured kinematics and, possibly, external forces are used to calculate net joint torques in a rigid body linked segment model. However, kinematics and forces are usually not consistent due to incorrect modelling assumptions and measurement errors. This is commonly resolved by introducing ‘residual forces and torques’ which compensate for this problem, but do not exist in reality. In this study a constrained optimization algorithm is proposed that finds the kinematics that are mechanically consistent with measured external forces and mimic the measured kinematics as closely as possible. The algorithm was tested on datasets containing planar kinematics and ground reaction forces obtained during human walking at three velocities (0.8 m/s, 1.25 and 1.8 m/s). Before optimization, the residual force and torque were calculated for a typical example. Both showed substantial values, indicating the necessity of developing a mechanically consistent algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm converged to a solution in which the residual forces and torques were zero, without changing the ground reaction forces and with only minor changes to the measured kinematics. When using a rigid body approach, our algorithm ensures a consistent description of forces and kinematics, thereby improving the validity of calculated net joint torque and power values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Faber","given":"Herre"},{"family":"Soest","given":"Arthur J.","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Kistemaker","given":"Dinant A."}],"citation-key":"faberInverseDynamicsMechanical2018","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0204575","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e0204575","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Inverse dynamics of mechanical multibody systems: An improved algorithm that ensures consistency between kinematics and external forces","title-short":"Inverse dynamics of mechanical multibody systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204575","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"fernandesRollDampingAssessment2009","abstract":"The methodology to obtain the non-linear roll damping from decay tests is very old. It has been proposed by Froude in the 19th century and used from then on. Behind it there is a quadratic model ⎡⎣θ  θ  ⎦⎤ for the damping and a subsequent equivalent linearization. Probably all model basin in the world follows this approach to assess the damping from a decay test. This is well documented and so is the methods to get the p1-p2 coefficients. This is very general in the sense that in principle, it could be applied to any kind of hull. However, it has become clear that for hull with a flat bottom such as a very large crude carrier (VLCC), this approach may lead to confusing results such as negative p2. Faced with this, the work presents a completely new idea. Avoiding the polynomial approximation, the basic attitude is to devise two regions from the decaying test response. The first, called the large amplitude response region yields a larger damping, probably due to the large bilge keel vortices that are attracted to the hull flat bottom. The second is the small amplitude response region where the vortices are not attracted to the bottom but travels approximately 45º sidewise. These observations has led to a new approach called the bi-linear approach as discussed in the work after analyzing several (many) model test results. In fact, a new modified bi-linear approach is ultimately proposed after the understanding of a transition region instead of a transition angle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Antonio C."},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Allan C."}],"citation-key":"fernandesRollDampingAssessment2009","container-title":"Journal of Marine Science and Application","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"fossenFiveStateExtendedKalman2021","abstract":"Small USVs are usually equipped with a low-cost navigation sensor suite consisting of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and a magnetic compass. Unfortunately, the magnetic compass is highly susceptible to electromagnetic disturbances. Hence, it should not be used in safety-critical autopilot systems. A gyrocompass, however, is highly reliable, but it is too expensive for most USV systems. It is tempting to compute the heading angle by using two GNSS antennas on the same receiver. Unfortunately, for small USV systems, the distance between the antennas is very small, requiring that an RTK GNSS receiver is used. The drawback of the RTK solution is that it suffers from dropouts due to ionospheric disturbances, multipath, interference, etc. For safety-critical applications, a more robust approach is to estimate the course angle to avoid using the heading angle during path following. The main result of this article is a five-state extended Kalman filter (EKF) aided by GNSS latitude-longitude measurements for estimation of the course over ground (COG), speed over ground (SOG), and course rate. These are the primary signals needed to implement a course autopilot system onboard a USV. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and easy to implement since only four EKF covariance parameters must be specified. The parameters need to be calibrated for different GNSS receivers and vehicle types, but they are not sensitive to the working conditions. Another advantage of the EKF is that the autopilot does not need to use the COG and SOG measurements from the GNSS receiver, which have varying quality and reliability. It is also straightforward to add complementary sensors such as a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) to the EKF to improve the performance further. Finally, the performance of the five-state EKF is demonstrated by experimental testing of two commercial USV systems.","author":[{"family":"Fossen","given":"Sindre"},{"family":"Fossen","given":"Thor"}],"citation-key":"fossenFiveStateExtendedKalman2021","container-title":"Sensors","container-title-short":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s21237910","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,27]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Five-State Extended Kalman Filter for Estimation of Speed over Ground (SOG), Course over Ground (COG), and Course Rate of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs): Experimental Results","title-short":"Five-State Extended Kalman Filter for Estimation of Speed over Ground (SOG), Course over Ground (COG), and Course Rate of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs)","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"franceInvestigationHeadseaParametric2003","abstract":"In October 1998 a post-Panamax C11 class containership encountered extreme weather and sustained extensive loss and damage to deck stowed containers. The motions of the vessel during this storm event were investigated through a series of model tests and numerical analyses that confirmed the vessel's parametric rolling response in head seas at the time of the casualty. These studies provide insight into the conditions in which post-Panamax containerships are likely to experience head sea parametric rolling, and the magnitude of motions and accelerations that can occur. The findings from this investigation are presented in this paper, together with discussion of how such extreme motions impact the design and application of container securing systems. Also outlined in the paper are recommendations for additional research needed to better understand the influence of vessel design and operational considerations on the propensity of post-Panamax containerships towards parametric rolling. This investigation and other recent studies demonstrate that parametric roll in extreme head or near head seas an occur when unfavorable tuning is combined with low roll damping (reduced speed) and large stability variations (governed by wavelength, wave height, general hull form, bow flare, and stern shapes). Parametric rolling is an unstable phenomenon, which can quickly generate large roll angles that are coupled with significant pitch motions. The rolling occurs in phase with pitch, and on containerships introduces high loads into the containers and their securing systems. It appears that post-Panamax containerships may be particularly prone to this behavior. This is an important issue considering the large number of these vessels scheduled for delivery in the next few years.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"France","given":"W.N."},{"family":"Levadou","given":"M."},{"family":"Treakle","given":"T.W."},{"family":"Paulling","given":"J.R."},{"family":"Michael","given":"R.K."}],"citation-key":"franceInvestigationHeadseaParametric2003","container-title":"Marine Technology and SNAME News","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"page":"1-19","source":"Scopus","title":"An investigation of head-sea parametric rolling and its influence on container lashing systems","type":"article-journal","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"gokcekLQRLQRTheory2001","abstract":"An extension of the LQR/LQG methodology to systems with saturating actuators, referred to as SLQR/SLQG, where S stands for saturating, is obtained. The development is based on the method of stochastic linearization, whereby the saturation is replaced by a gain, calculated as a function of the variance of the signal at its input. Using the stochastically linearized system and the Lagrange multiplier technique, solutions of the SLQR/SLQG problems are derived. These solutions are given by standard Riccati and Lyapunov equations coupled with two transcendental equations, which characterize both the variance of the signal at the saturation input and the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constrained minimization problem. It is shown that, under standard stabilizability and detectability conditions, these equations have a unique solution, which can be found by a simple bisection algorithm. When the level of saturation tends to infinity, these equations reduce to their standard LQR/LQG counterparts. In addition, the paper investigates the properties of closed-loop systems with SLQR/SLQG controllers and saturating actuators. In this regard, it is shown that SLQR/SLQG controllers ensure semi-global stability by appropriate choice of a parameter in the performance criterion. Finally, the paper illustrates the techniques developed by a ship roll damping problem.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Gökçek","given":"C."},{"family":"Kabamba","given":"P.T."},{"family":"Meerkov","given":"S.M."}],"citation-key":"gokcekLQRLQRTheory2001","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","DOI":"10.1109/9.956049","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"1529-1542","source":"Scopus","title":"An LQR/LQR theory for systems with saturating actuators","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"hanStochasticInverseIdentification2012","abstract":"The nonlinear responses of ship rolling motion characterized by a roll damping moment are of great interest to naval architects and ocean engineers. Modeling and identification of the nonlinear damping moment are essential to incorporate the inherent nonlinearity in design, analysis, and control of a ship. A stochastic nonparametric approach for identification of nonlinear damping in the general mechanical system has been presented in the literature (Han and Kinoshits 2012). The method has been also applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship at zero-forward speed (Han and Kinoshits 2013). In the presence of forward speed, however, the characteristic of roll damping moment of a ship is significantly changed due to the lift effect. In this paper, the stochastic inverse method is applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship moving at nonzero-forward speed. The workability and validity of the method are verified with laboratory tests under controlled conditions. In experimental trials, two different types of ship rolling motion are considered: time-dependent transient motion and frequency-dependent periodic motion. It is shown that this method enables the inherent nonlinearity in damping moment to be estimated, including its reliability analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Han","given":"S.

Improving hydrodynamic model accuracy without compromising computational efficiency has always been of high interest for safe and cost-effective marine operations. With continuous development of sensor technology and computational capacity, an improved digital twin concept for vessel motion prediction can be realized based on an onboard online adaptive hydrodynamic model. This article proposes and demonstrates a practical approach for tuning of important vessel hydrodynamic model parameters based on simulated onboard sensor data of vessel motion response. The algorithm relies fundamentally on spectral analysis, probabilistic modelling and the discrete Bayesian updating formula. All case studies show promising and reasonable tuning results. Sensitivities of the approach with respect to its key parameters were also studied. Sensor noise has been considered. The algorithm is found to be computationally efficient, robust and stable when tuning the values of hydrodynamic parameters and updating their uncertainties, within reasonable sensor noise levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Leira","given":"Bernt Johan"},{"family":"Sævik","given":"Svein"}],"citation-key":"hanVesselHydrodynamicModel2021","container-title":"Ocean Engineering","container-title-short":"Ocean Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2020.108407","ISSN":"0029-8018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,15]]},"language":"en","page":"108407","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Vessel hydrodynamic model tuning by Discrete Bayesian updating using simulated onboard sensor data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801820313147","volume":"220"},
  {"id":"hassaniVirtualPrototypingMaritime2016","abstract":"While in aerospace and automotive industry, airplanes and cars are built in quantity, in maritime industry ships and offshore platforms are built uniquely such that even sister ships can be significantly different from each other. Hence, building a full scale prototype to test, verify, and demonstrate effectiveness of new innovative solutions, is not an option in maritime sector. Model testing and simulation of separate modules have been practiced in many applications successfully, however, capturing the complete interaction of different modules in a maritime system is not straight forward. To best of our knowledge, the modeling and simulation of a maritime system to the extent where the complete system, including the mutual interactions, is not accomplished yet. A maritime system incorporates a wide variety of components from different engineering fields and in order to develop a simulation framework for such a complex system, an interdisciplinary effort is needed from different branches of science including but not limited to hydrodynamics, machinery and power systems, structural engineering, navigation and control. This paper aims to introduce a joint effort from different research institutes, universities, and industrial partners to shed a light on the different issues in virtual prototyping in maritime systems and operations. It summarizes some of the available frameworks for virtual prototyping, and ends with a numerical simulation of a generic hull model coupled with propellers, propeller actuators, DP controller, thrust loss calculations, wind, waves and current, performed with the current implementation of our Virtual Prototyping Framework (VPF).","author":[{"family":"Hassani","given":"Vahid"},{"family":"Rindarøy","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Kyllingstad","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Jørgen"},{"family":"Sadjina","given":"Severin"},{"family":"Skjong","given":"Stian"},{"family":"Fathi","given":"Dariusz"},{"family":"Johnsen","given":"Trond"},{"family":"Æsøy","given":"Vilmar"},{"family":"Pedersen","given":"Eilif"}],"citation-key":"hassaniVirtualPrototypingMaritime2016","DOI":"10.1115/OMAE2016-54886","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,19]]},"page":"V007T06A018","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Virtual Prototyping of Maritime Systems and Operations","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"heBlackBoxModelingShip2020","abstract":"This paper deals with the black-box modeling of 3-DOF nonlinear maneuvering motion of surface ships by using system identification method based on BP neural network. A Mariner Class vessel is taken as the study object. The time series used in training and testing the network is the simulated data of a series of maneuvers, which is obtained by numerically solving the Abkowitz model using fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. A three-layer neural network is built to solve this multivariable regression fitting problem, and only one network model is trained to predict various ship maneuvers. Taking the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function, the network’s weights are optimized by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm effectively. The trained network is evaluated by several simulation tests, and it is shown that the network achieves good prediction ability and can predict the maneuvering motion as long as the control inputs and initial states of the ship motion are known.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Hong-Wei"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Zao-Jian"}],"citation-key":"heBlackBoxModelingShip2020","container-title":"Volume 6B: Ocean Engineering","DOI":"10.1115/OMAE2020-18069","event-place":"Virtual, Online","event-title":"ASME 2020 39th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","ISBN":"978-0-7918-8438-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,3]]},"language":"en","page":"V06BT06A037","publisher":"American Society of Mechanical Engineers","publisher-place":"Virtual, Online","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Black-Box Modeling of Ship Maneuvering Motion Using System Identification Method Based on BP Neural Network","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/OMAE/proceedings/OMAE2020/84386/Virtual,%20Online/1092994"},
  {"id":"heNonparametricModelingShip2022","abstract":"A self-designed fully connected neural network is proposed for nonparametric modeling of ship maneuvering motion by extracting the dynamic characteristics of ship motion from observed input-output data. The automatic design is conducted by Bayesian optimization, which aims at minimizing the validation error with respect to different hyperparameter settings of the neural network, including learning rate, activation function, as well as network depth and widths. Gaussian process is adopted as the surrogate model to estimate the unobserved validation errors, and lower confidence bound is adopted for trading off exploration and exploitation in the process of optimization. Taking the KVLCC2 ship as the study object, the experimental data provided by Hamburg Ship Model Basin is utilized for modeling and validation of prediction, and the detailed procedures to prepare and preprocess the input-output data are discussed. After well designed and trained, the selected neural network model is evaluated by the prediction results of ship maneuvers in comparison with the experimental data. It shows the high prediction accuracy and strong generalization ability of the established neural network model, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Hong-Wei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zi-Hao"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Zao-Jian"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yi"}],"citation-key":"heNonparametricModelingShip2022","container-title":"Ocean Engineering","container-title-short":"Ocean Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.111113","ISSN":"00298018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"language":"en","page":"111113","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Nonparametric modeling of ship maneuvering motion based on self-designed fully connected neural network","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002980182200525X","volume":"251"},

  {"id":"hillenbrandDEVELOPMENT30SCALE2021","abstract":"With the current developments of wind powered and wind assisted vessels comes the need for realistic ship model testing. Traditional test methods of free sailing models are somewhat limited by the difficulties to mimic the effects of the wind propulsion systems or at least for recreating them at the correct scale. Simulations are possible but time consuming and they cannot grasp all aspects that free sailing models comprise. At the KTH Maritime Robotics Laboratory, a 1:30 scale model of Oceanbird was developed and equipped with numerous sensors to enable accurate and realistic measurements while sailing in unrestrained waters. The paper presents the model’s equipment and experimental results showing the abilities of the sailing demonstrator to gather high quality data for manoeuvring and aerodynamic studies. In particular, the definition of a zigzag manoeuvre for sailing ships is explained and results of tests are evaluated regarding manoeuvrability and aerodynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hillenbrand","given":"A"},{"family":"Dhomé","given":"U"},{"family":"Kuttenkeuler","given":"J"},{"family":"Razola","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"hillenbrandDEVELOPMENT30SCALE2021","container-title":"Wind Propulsion 2021","container-title-short":"WIN21","DOI":"10.3940/rina.win.2021.10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"DEVELOPMENT OF A 1:30 SCALE SAILING MODEL OF OCEANBIRD","title-short":"DEVELOPMENT OF A 1","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.rina.org.uk/past_events.html"},

  {"id":"hooftNonlinearHydrodynamicHullforces","abstract":"In many situations the manoeuvering performance of ships is largely effected by the non-linear contributions of the hydrodynamic reaction forces on the hull. The origin of these non-linear components can be ascertained from experiments with segmented models. In this paper a review is given of the analysis of the segmented model tests which have been reported in literature so far. From the results derived from this analysis it will be shown that the non-linear hull force and moment components can be described in a robust manner by means of a longitudinal distribution of the so-called cross-flow drag coefficient. Thus, a good description of the ship's manoeuvrability is acquired for the entire speed range of a vessel, including the transition from the manoeuvres at service speed with relatively small drift angles to the manoeuvres at reduced speed (harbour manoeuvering) with large drift angles.","author":[{"family":"Hooft","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Quadvlieg","given":"Frans"}],"citation-key":"hooftNonlinearHydrodynamicHullforces","language":"en","page":"11","source":"Zotero","title":"Non-linear hydrodynamic hullforces derived from segmented model tests","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"ichimuraShippingEraDigitalization2022","abstract":"The so-called “Fourth Industrial revolution”, also termed as “Industry 4.0” in the wider literature, is associated with several cutting-edge technologies. Indicative examples in this category are advanced applications like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data Analytics (BDA), Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT), which are already influencing the maritime industry. It is indicative of the fact that there are several construction projects of autonomous ships, such as the Yara Birkeland and the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS), which are heavily reliant on technologies associated with the Industry 4.0 concept. The maritime transport industry is already transitioning into a new operations paradigm, often termed as “shipping in the era of digitalization”. Shipping companies promote digitalization as the future of the maritime industry and their efforts to set up strategies are already in progress. Examining those visions and strategies in relation to digitalization would be beneficial to better understand the way towards which the maritime industry is heading. This paper is aiming to identify the characteristics of that pool of future plans via a qualitative review and with a particular focus on major maritime commercial actors, based on shipping companies' relevant action plans that were gathered online. A conclusion standing out is that major shipping companies have embraced digitalization to increase cost-efficiency, raise competitiveness and meet the needs of their customers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ichimura","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Dalaklis","given":"Dimitrios"},{"family":"Kitada","given":"Momoko"},{"family":"Christodoulou","given":"Anastasia"}],"citation-key":"ichimuraShippingEraDigitalization2022","container-title":"Digital Business","container-title-short":"Digital Business","DOI":"10.1016/j.digbus.2022.100022","ISSN":"2666-9544","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100022","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Shipping in the era of digitalization: Mapping the future strategic plans of major maritime commercial actors","title-short":"Shipping in the era of digitalization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666954422000023","volume":"2"},

The main advantage of the procedure is that the coefficients of the model directly correspond to the hydrodynamic derivatives. The identification algorithm consists of the IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) digital filters and RLS (Recursive Least Square) method. To discuss the reliability of the identified coefficients, the procedure is applied to a full-scale ship's data and the results are compared to the hydrodynamic derivatives provided by the shipbuilding company.

Forecasts of the vessels’ trajectories and motions are fundamentally based on the mathematical manoeuvring model, which is an essential component of their hydrodynamic digital twin nowadays. Using the benchmark container ship KCS as an object of study, this paper adopts a 4-DOF modular-type manoeuvring (MMG) model to predict the vessel trajectories in calm water and under the presence of steady current and regular waves. The current effects are treated as additional ship over water speed, while the wave effects are considered by superimposing the second-order mean wave drift loads to the calm water hull hydrodynamics. The wave drift loads are solved using the potential ﬂow solver WASIM, which is based on Rankine panel method. The computed vessel trajectories and motions are compared with available literature results and show good correlation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Jin","given":"Yuting"},{"family":"Yiew","given":"Lucas J."},{"family":"Magee","given":"Allan R."},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Yingying"}],"citation-key":"jinSystemBasedModellingKCS2020","container-title":"Volume 6A: Ocean Engineering","DOI":"10.1115/OMAE2020-18625","event-place":"Virtual, Online","event-title":"ASME 2020 39th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","ISBN":"978-0-7918-8437-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,3]]},"language":"en","page":"V06AT06A050","publisher":"American Society of Mechanical Engineers","publisher-place":"Virtual, Online","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"System-Based Modelling of KCS Manoeuvring in Calm Water, Current and Waves","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/OMAE/proceedings/OMAE2020/84379/Virtual,%20Online/1092845"},

The General ArrangementGeneral Arrangement (GA) (GA) of a double-ended ferryDouble-Ended Ferry (DE-ferry) is mainly built around the need to carry a certain number of cars. Double-ended ferries have strict schedules which can only be achieved by hydrodynamically optimized hull design, trim, efficient propulsion system and low lightweight. The present chapter “Double-Ended FerryDouble-Ended Ferry (DE-ferry)” focuses on the synthesis of software tools forming the Intelligent GA s/w platformPlatform (IGAIntelligent General Arrangement (IGA)) that is used in the double-ended ferryDouble-Ended Ferry (DE-ferry) case studyCase study. Software tools forming the Intelligent GA are CAESESComputer Aided Engineering System Empowering Simulation by FRIENDSHIP SYSTEMS, Germany (CAESES) (hull design), Cadmatic (structure and outfittingOutfitting), NAPANaval Architecture Package for ship design by NAPA Oy, Finland (NAPA) (stability), HSVA’s Fresco+RANSE solver by HSVA and Technical University Hamburg (FreSCo) (resistance and propulsion), HSVA’s ν-shalloNon-linear potential flow code for wave resistance analysis of ships in calm water by HSVA (ν-Shallo) (wave resistance), BV’sBureau Veritas, France (BV) Mars2000 (midship analysis) and BV’s SEECATShip Energy Efficiency Calculation and Analysis Tool (SEECAT®) (energy simulations). The Intelligent GA utilizes parallel multi-disciplinary design and analysis, which is made possible by use of surrogate modelsSurrogate models, as they have been introduced in the HOLISHIPHOLIstic optimisation of SHIP design and operation for lifecycle (EU H2020 project) (HOLISHIP) project. The chapter elaborates on the links between CAESESComputer Aided Engineering System Empowering Simulation by FRIENDSHIP SYSTEMS, Germany (CAESES), Cadmatic and other tools, namely how the general arrangementGeneral Arrangement (GA) data are transferred between CAESESComputer Aided Engineering System Empowering Simulation by FRIENDSHIP SYSTEMS, Germany (CAESES) and Cadmatic during the design process.

The stability section explains the link to NAPANaval Architecture Package for ship design by NAPA Oy, Finland (NAPA) ad what intact and damage stability rules are applied for the double-ended ferryDouble-Ended Ferry (DE-ferry), which is classified as “D” class according to NON-SOLASSafety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) rules. Of key interest for a zero or reduced emissions double-ended ferryDouble-Ended Ferry (DE-ferry) is the optimal dimensioning of the batteries’ capacity. The chapter explains how the batteries were dimensioned and compares the fully electric vessel against a hybrid version where the batteries are the main source for propulsion and diesel engines/generators are the auxiliary source of energy. The final general arrangementGeneral Arrangement (GA)/design of the double-ended ferryDouble-Ended Ferry (DE-ferry) is the synthesis of all naval architectural disciplines and is presented at the end of the chapter.

  {"id":"kanazawaBridgingSimilarShips2023","abstract":"System identification (SI) approach identifies ship maneuvering models using data from free-running maneuvers. As it is impossible to comprehensively validate model performance, a reliable model must be built within a consistent range with similar ships’ models. However, in the SI approach, models are greatly influenced by the dataset design and feature selection, leading to the instability of model identification and the failure to ensure such consistency. To address this issue, our new idea introduces similar ship’s model into model identification as knowledge foundation. First, we select a similar ship with three-step procedure, then build a new model by refining model parameters for a similar ship. Such a refinement is conducted with additional l2 regularization term in ridge regression, which balances knowledge and data-driven refinement. Designing the safe range of such refinement with hyperparameters, this study helps designers find a robust-and-accurate model within designed safe zones. In simulation experiments, we built knowledge connection between 161 m and 175 m container ships. By using the well-validated model of the former, a robust-and-accurate model for the latter was easily built by using a limited dataset, resulting in excellent model performance.

  {"id":"katoFrictionalResistanceRolling1957","abstract":"The resistance to rolling is of great importance to investigate the safety of vessels in rough seas. The passive resistance due to the action of the water is mainly composed of three kinds, i.e., the frictional resistance, the eddy making resistance and the wave making resistance Of these resistances only the wave making one was shown in the author's previous paper to follow the law of comparison for similar ships. It is therefore necessary to establish formulae for the frictional and eddy making resistances in order to extend the results of model experiments to actual ships.In the present paper new formulae for the frictional resistance are obtained after analysing the results of experiments on the oscillations of suspended cylinders wholly immersed in the water. The frictional coefficient Cf for oscillating cylinders is found to be expressed in the form exactly same as that given by H. Blasius for laminar flow, if Reynolds number Rn be taken as 3.22r2θm2/Tv The decrement of roll per swing due to friction for a ship model without bilge keels in fresh water is given by the formula dθf=2.11Srs2θm/WmT1.5 at 15°C in kg, m, sec, deg, units : and the decrement for a ship model with bilge keels is written as dθf=2.11Srs2θm/WmT1.5 {1+0.143 (rsθm) 0.772/T0.386} at 15°C.in which the frictional coefficient for turbulent flow is used from the following formula given by G.

  {"id":"kianejadNumericalAssessmentRoll2018","abstract":"Accurate calculation of the roll damping moment at resonance condition is essential for roll motion prediction. Because at the resonance condition, the moment of inertia counteracts restoring moment and only the damping moment resists increase in the roll angle. There are various methods to calculate the roll damping moment which are based on potential ﬂow theory. These methods have limitations to taking into account the viscous effects in estimating the roll motion, while, CFD as a numerical method is capable of considering the viscous effects. In this study, a CFD method based on a harmonic excited roll motion (HERM) technique is used to compute the roll motion and the roll damping moment of a containership’s model in different conditions. The inﬂuence of excitation frequency, forward speed and degrees of freedom at beam-sea and oblique-sea realizations are considered in estimating the roll damping coefﬁcients. The results are validated against model tests, where a good agreement is found.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kianejad","given":"S.S."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jaesuk"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Enshaei","given":"Hossein"}],"citation-key":"kianejadNumericalAssessmentRoll2018","container-title":"Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","container-title-short":"JMSE","DOI":"10.3390/jmse6030101","ISSN":"2077-1312","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"101","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Numerical Assessment of Roll Motion Characteristics and Damping Coefficient of a Ship","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/6/3/101","volume":"6"},

Waves are one of the most influential factors that undermine ship control. In this study, we investigate the maneuvering ability of the benchmark Japan Bulk Carrier (JBC) in calm water and in waves. Turning circle tests are conducted via system-based analysis and direct CFD method in calm water condition. Comparison of system-based analysis with experiments and direct CFD method have shown to be satisfactory. After validation of the mathematical model, empirical relations are used to include the ship drift in irregular wave conditions. Two different cases are considered. The first one is with constant significant wave height and changing wave angles. The second case is with constant wave angle but different significant wave height. The ship drift was observed to be in the direction of wave propagation, growing larger with increasing wave height.

  {"id":"kjellbergFullyNonlinearUnsteady2013","abstract":"The prediction of the behavior of ships in a seaway has been an important topic in ship design since the beginning of modern naval architecture. In recent years, computer simulations using numerical methods based on mathematical models of the ship hydrodynamics problem has become a valuable tool for researchers and engineers working in this field. A large variety of methods with different levels of sophistication and accuracy already exist today, all being suitable for specific problems. However, with the current trend of larger, more advanced and optimized designs and focus turning more and more towards safety and energy efficiency, nonlinear phenomena are becoming more important and many of the traditional methods have problems in producing accurate results for certain cases due to assumptions and neglected physical effects in the underlying mathematical model. The overall objective of this project is the development and implementation of a fully nonlinear unsteady three-dimensional boundary element method for ship motion analysis, applicable to problems with a high degree of nonlinearities while still being suitable for practical use. The method is capable of predicting wave induced loads and motions with actual forward speed, taking into account implicitly all kinds of nonlinearities, i.e. higher and lower order frequency components, hull shape above the calm water level and self interaction between the forward speed flow field as well as radiated and diffracted waves. This thesis presents the mathematical model, the numerical method and numerical results obtained from the application of the method to a number of relevant test cases. Results from the application of the method are provided, including the propagation of a regular long-crested wave, the wave resistance problem in calm water and the radiation and diffraction problem in regular and irregular head sea. The results are limited to heave and pitch motions and are compared with analytical or experimental data, numerical results from other methods or, in some cases, both. The method has proved to be able to capture strong nonlinear effects in heave and pitch motions and its feasibility as a qualified analysis tool for such cases has been demonstrated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kjellberg","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"kjellbergFullyNonlinearUnsteady2013","ISBN":"9789173858700","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Chalmers University of Technology","source":"research.chalmers.se","title":"Fully Nonlinear Unsteady Three-Dimensional Boundary Element Method for Ship Motions in Waves","type":"thesis","URL":"https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/180980"},

This places new requirements on the tools used in ship design, as well as the methods usually applied in sailing yacht design.

The setting is that of a ship section moored by a bottom mounted terminal which are exposed to regular waves. The ship section is allowed to oscillate in three degrees of freedom: Sway, heave and roll. We investigate in particular the damping caused by flow separation from the bilge keels. This has importance near resonance. The investigation is carried out by means of model tests as well as by a linear wavetank and a fully nonlinear numerical wavetank. Both are time-domain wavetanks based on a Boundary Element Method (BEM) and the mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian (MEL) formalism. Flow separation is modelled in the nonlinear numerical wavetank by means of an inviscid vortex tracking method. We focus on the, under resonant condition, large-amplitude massive piston-like fluid motion in between the ship and the terminal and the associated large ship motions. We do not focus on the sloshing problem associated with higher modes. In resonant condition, large piston-mode motion occurs when the sway and heave motions are downwards and towards the terminal simultaneously.An alternative formulation of the forces and moment is derived and implemented into the nonlinear numerical wavetank as a means to circumvent the problems related to the, term in the Bernoulli equation in the presently adopted MEL approach. © 2010.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Kristiansen","given":"T."},{"family":"Faltinsen","given":"O.M."}],"citation-key":"kristiansenTwodimensionalNumericalExperimental2010","container-title":"Applied Ocean Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.apor.2009.10.001","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"158-176","source":"Scopus","title":"A two-dimensional numerical and experimental study of resonant coupled ship and piston-mode motion","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},

The modeling approach combines conventional analysis models based on physical principles (a white-box model) with a feed forward neural-network (a black-box model). Two different ways of combining these models are presented, in series and in parallel. The results of simulating several trips of a medium sized container vessel show that the grey-box modeling approach, both serial and parallel approaches, can improve the prediction of the vessel fuel consumption significantly compared to a white-box model.

  {"id":"liShipManeuverabilityModeling2022","abstract":"To obtain an accurate ship maneuverability model for motion prediction and autonomous navigation, a ship maneuverability modeling and numerical prediction method is proposed based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A Mathematical Model Group (MMG) model is utilized to describe the ship maneuverability with data from virtual captive model and free-running tests. Static Oblique Towing Test (OTT) and dynamic Circular Motion Test (CMT) are both performed to acquire necessary data for the MMG model identification. The forces and moments acting on ship hull are predicted by solving unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. The MMG hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained with the results of captive model tests. In the free-running simulations, to reduce the computational cost of considerable propeller grids, a body force propeller method is introduced to provide thrust forces directly, and the ship motion is handled by overset grids of ship hull and rudder. A 3-degree of freedom MMG model is identified with numerical simulation results, i.e., the self-propulsion test, rudder angle 35°turning test and 15/1 zig-zag test, for a standard KRISO Container Ship (KCS). These tests show that the motion prediction and free-running maneuvering results can agree with the standard experimental data well. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"S."},{"family":"Liu","given":"C."},{"family":"Chu","given":"X."},{"family":"Zheng","given":"M."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Z."},{"family":"Kan","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"liShipManeuverabilityModeling2022","container-title":"Ocean Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.112454","ISSN":"0029-8018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"English","source":"Scopus","title":"Ship maneuverability modeling and numerical prediction using CFD with body force propeller","type":"article-journal","volume":"264"},

The methods are based on a comparison between the measured outputs and the outputs of a candidate model. Depending on the set of models that is used, such methods are known under a variety of names, like output-error methods, equation-error methods, maximum-likelihood methods, etc. General results are proved concerning the models that are selected asymptotically as the number of observed data tends to infinity. For these results it is not assumed that the true system necessarily can be exactly represented within the chosen set of models. In the particular case when the model set contains the system, general consistency results are obtained and commented upon. Rather than to seek an exact description of the system, it is usually more realistic to be content with a suitable approximation of the true system with reasonable complexity properties.

System identification is a very large topic, with different techniques that depend on the character of the models to be estimated: linear, nonlinear, hybrid, nonparametric, etc. At the same time, the area can be characterized by a small number of leading principles, e.g. to look for sustainable descriptions by proper decisions in the triangle of model complexity, information contents in the data, and effective validation. The area has many facets and there are many approaches and methods. A tutorial or a survey in a few pages is not quite possible.

Previous numerical computations have succeeded only in integrating the equations of motion up to the instant when the surface becomes vertical. In this paper we present a new method for following the time-history of space-periodic irrotational surface waves. The only independent variables are the coordinates and velocity potential of marked particles at the free surface. At each time-step an integral equation is solved for the new normal component of velocity. The method is faster and more accurate than previous methods based on a two dimensional grid. It has also the advantage that the marked particles become concentrated near regions of sharp curvature. Viscosity and surface tension are both neglected. The method is tested on a free, steady wave of finite amplitude, and is found to give excellent agreement with independent calculations based on Stokes’s series. It is then applied to unsteady waves, produced by initially applying an asymmetric distribution of pressure to a symmetric, progres­sive wave. The freely running wave then steepens and overturns. It is demonstrated that the surface remains rounded till well after the over­turning takes place.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Longuet-Higgins","given":"Michael Selwyn"},{"family":"Cokelet","given":"E.

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Lorenz","given":"Edward N."}],"citation-key":"lorenzDeterministicNonperiodicFlow1963","container-title":"Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences","DOI":"10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020<0130:DNF>2.0.CO;2","ISSN":"0022-4928, 1520-0469","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1963",3,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"130-141","publisher":"American Meteorological Society","section":"Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences","source":"journals.ametsoc.org","title":"Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/20/2/1520-0469_1963_020_0130_dnf_2_0_co_2.xml","volume":"20"},

A discussion of future developments and trends concludes the paper.","author":[{"family":"Major","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Houxiang"},{"family":"Hildre","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Edet","given":"Mathieu"}],"citation-key":"majorVirtualPrototypingOffshore2020","container-title":"Ship Technology Research","container-title-short":"Ship Technology Research","DOI":"10.1080/09377255.2020.1831840","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,15]]},"page":"1-18","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Virtual prototyping of offshore operations: a review","title-short":"Virtual prototyping of offshore operations","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"marimongiovannettiEffectsHydrodynamicForces2020","abstract":"Assessing the manoeuvring performances of a ship at a design stage is becoming more important, especially when trying to improve shipping efficiency to reduce fuel consumption.\nWhen designing a hull with appendages, it is necessary to balance hydrodynamic efficiency with manoeuvrability. Therefore, the possibility of simulating a captive test at a design stage will increase the chances of understanding the behaviour of a ship from an early stage in the design process. The current research is based on the evaluation of hydrodynamic efficiency of a hull and appendages in a pure resistance, self-propulsion and in a wind-assisted mode.\nThe forces and moments acting on the hull and appendages are then analysed and used as inputs for a Virtual Captive Test (VCT) [1]. In order to correctly perform a VCT and further analyse the performances of a ship with a Velocity Prediction Programme (VPP), particular care has been put in correctly capturing the manoeuvrability coefficients. Those are derived with polynomial fittings once the forces and moments acting on the ship are extracted from the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.\nMany CFD simulations were performed to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hull and appendages in a range of flow directions, rudder angles and rotating flow. Those simulations encompass the whole range of datapoints needed to describe a wind-assisted ship during manoeuvring.\nTaking into consideration both hydrodynamic characteristics and manoeuvrability effects at an early design stage can reduce model tests costs and will allow to inspect a larger number of hull-appendages scenarios when analysing the final VPP results.","author":[{"family":"Marimon Giovannetti","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Olsson","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Alexandersson","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Werner","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Finnsgård","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"marimongiovannettiEffectsHydrodynamicForces2020","DOI":"10.1115/OMAE2020-18673","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,3]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"The Effects of Hydrodynamic Forces on Maneuvrability Coefficients for Wind-Assisted Ships","type":"book"},
  {"id":"marzoukControlShipRoll2009","abstract":"We numerically studied the full (six degrees of freedom) motion of a cargo ship without roll stabilizers in rough (sea state 5) conditions for multiple heading angles ranging from 0° (follower seas) to 180° (head seas). We found that the ship exhibits excessive roll motion in quartering (45° off the stern), beam, and head seas. Therefore, roll damping is critical in these conditions. We then investigated the performance of passive and active anti-roll tank (ART) systems and compared their performance in each of the three sea conditions. Each ART consists of three identical tanks, distributed along the centerline of the ship, each of which consists of two vertical ducts connected at the bottom with a horizontal duct. A pump is located at the middle of the horizontal duct of each tank. The pumps are switched on for active ARTs but switched off for passive ones. The loads (forces and moments) exerted on the ship by the ARTs are added to the hydrodynamic loads (e.g., due to pressure and viscous effects) and the thrust in the governing equations of motion of the ship. Whereas both passive and active ARTs are able to reduce the excessive roll motion, active ARTs outperform the passive ones from three perspectives. First, they are more effective in reducing the roll motion. Second, they require much less working liquid. Third, their performance is insensitive to their natural frequencies and, hence, to their geometric design. In addition, we found that head seas are most responsive to ARTs, which suggests that they are effective in mitigating parametric roll. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  {"id":"milanovEXPERIMENTALSTUDYKCS2020","abstract":"Since the Energy Efficiency Design Index EEDI was introduced by International Maritime Organization IMO, an increasing attention to the ship's controllability in waves, in particular at low speed is observed. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that, in order to satisfy the EEDI requirements, there is a tendency to reduce the power consumption and the propellers RPM reduction while maintaining existing control means, which results in reduced ship steerability mainly at low speed. This study considers the effect of regular sea waves on ship’s initial turning parameters at the set of service conditions. By means of free running model tests the influence of low advance speed on course and maneuvering trajectory changes in transient turning motion were investigated. The effects of the wave encounter angle variations were examined during the tests, including application of different wave lengths. Using the experimental results, an attempt was made to normalize the ship's handling in adverse sea conditions by applying a simple criterion based on the initial time to reach a given course. The results of the present study can be used for benchmarking of numerical simulations of low speed maneuvers in regular waves.","author":[{"family":"Milanov","given":"Evgeni"},{"family":"Efremov","given":"Dobrin"},{"family":"Anastasov","given":"Anton"}],"citation-key":"milanovEXPERIMENTALSTUDYKCS2020","container-title":"Maritime Technology and Research","container-title-short":"Maritime Technology and Research","DOI":"10.33175/mtr.2021.245803","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"page":"Manuscript","source":"ResearchGate","title":"EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON KCS CONTAINER SHIP INITIAL TURNING AT LOW SPEED IN REGULAR WAVES","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"millerShipModelIdentification2021","abstract":"Modeling is the most important component in predictive controller design. It should predict outputs precisely and fast. Thus, it must be adequate for the ship dynamics while having as simple a structure as possible. In a good ship model the standard deviation of a particular coefﬁcient should not exceed 10% of its value. Fitting the validation data to 80% for short-term prediction and 65% for long-term prediction is treated as a declared benchmark for model usage in ship course predictive controller. Regularization was proposed to ensure better state-space models to ﬁt the real ship dynamics and more accurate standard deviation value control. Usage of the simulation results and real-time trials, as model estimation and validation data, respectively, during the identiﬁcation procedure is proposed. In the ﬁrst step a predictive linear model is identiﬁed conventionally, and then coefﬁcients are regularized, based on the validation data, using a genetic algorithm. Particular linearized model coefﬁcient standard deviations were decreased from more than 100% of their values to approximately 5% of them using genetic algorithm tuning. Moreover, the proposed method eliminated model output signal oscillations, which were observed during the validation process based on experimental data, gained during ship trials. Improved mapping of ship dynamics was achieved. Fit to validation data increased from 71% and 54% to 89% and 76%, respectively, for shortterm and long-term prediction. The proposed method, which may be applied to real applications, is easily applicable and reliable. The tuned model is sufﬁciently suited to plant dynamics and may be used for future predictive control purposes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"millerShipModelIdentification2021","container-title":"Applied Sciences","container-title-short":"Applied Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/app11125504","ISSN":"2076-3417","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,14]]},"language":"en","page":"5504","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ship Model Identification with Genetic Algorithm Tuning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/12/5504","volume":"11"},

With several tools appearing in Digital Twin software suites, high-quality manoeuvring and performance prediction remain cornerstones. Propulsion efficiency is in focus while in service. Simulator-based training is in focus to ensure safety of manoeuvring in confined waters and harbours. Prediction of ships’ velocity and turn rate are essential for correct look and feel during training, but phenomena like dynamic inflow to propellers, bank and shallow water effects limit simulators’ accuracy, and master mariners often comment that simulations could be in better agreement with actual behaviours of their vessel. This paper focuses on digital twin enhancements to better match reality. Using data logged during in-service operation, we first consider a system identification perspective, employing a first-principles model structure. Showing that a complete first-principles model is not identifiable under the excitation met in service, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network to predict deviations between measured velocities and the model output. The outcome is a hybrid of a first-principles model with a machine learning generic approximator add-on. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy of both in-harbour manoeuvring and shallow water passage conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Rasmus E."},{"family":"Papageorgiou","given":"Dimitrios"},{"family":"Nalpantidis","given":"Lazaros"},{"family":"Jensen","given":"Bugge T."},{"family":"Blanke","given":"Mogens"}],"citation-key":"nielsenMachineLearningEnhancement2022","container-title":"Ocean Engineering","container-title-short":"Ocean Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.111579","ISSN":"00298018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"en","page":"111579","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Machine learning enhancement of manoeuvring prediction for ship Digital Twin using full-scale recordings","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0029801822009453","volume":"257"},

  {"id":"pawApproximationNonlinearRoll","abstract":"The paper discusses how to get the proper estimation of the non-linear damping moment in ship roll with the help of free roll tests. It demonstrates two major points, 1° that the damping moment in terms of approximation is an odd non-analytic function, 2° the standard method based on the ratio of two consecutive amplitudes is of limited meaning for non-linear roll. A new method is proposed, based on approximation of free roll, using the instantaneous values of the logarithmic decrement of damping. It is assumed that the instantaneous values are identical with the equivalent values, obtained from equating work done over one cycle.","author":[{"family":"Paw","given":"Maciej"}],"citation-key":"pawApproximationNonlinearRoll","language":"en","page":"7","source":"Zotero","title":"Approximation of the non-linear roll damping","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"pearlCausalInferenceStatistics2009","abstract":"This review presents empirical researchers with recent advances in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attribution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearl","given":"Judea"}],"citation-key":"pearlCausalInferenceStatistics2009","container-title":"Statistics Surveys","DOI":"10.1214/09-SS057","ISSN":"1935-7516","issue":"none","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1]]},"page":"96-146","publisher":"Amer.

  {"id":"PriorProbability2023","abstract":"A prior probability distribution of an uncertain quantity, often simply called the prior, is its assumed probability distribution before some evidence is taken into account. For example, the prior could be the probability distribution representing the relative proportions of voters who will vote for a particular politician in a future election. The unknown quantity may be a parameter of the model or a latent variable rather than an observable variable.\nIn Bayesian statistics, Bayes' rule prescribes how to update the prior with new information to obtain the posterior probability distribution, which is the conditional distribution of the uncertain quantity given new data. Historically, the choice of priors was often constrained to a conjugate family of a given likelihood function, for that it would result in a tractable posterior of the same family. The widespread availability of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, however, has made this less of a concern.\nThere are many ways to construct a prior distribution. In some cases, a prior may be determined from past information, such as previous experiments. A prior can also be elicited from the purely subjective assessment of an experienced expert. When no information is available, an uninformative prior may be adopted as justified by the principle of indifference. In modern applications, priors are also often chosen for their mechanical properties, such as regularization and feature selection.The prior distributions of model parameters will often depend on parameters of their own. Uncertainty about these hyperparameters can, in turn, be expressed as hyperprior probability distributions. For example, if one uses a beta distribution to model the distribution of the parameter p of a Bernoulli distribution, then:\n\np is a parameter of the underlying system (Bernoulli distribution), and\nα and β are parameters of the prior distribution (beta distribution); hence hyperparameters.In principle, priors can be decomposed into many conditional levels of distributions, so-called hierarchical priors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,29]]},"citation-key":"PriorProbability2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,9]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1143757043","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Prior probability","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prior_probability&oldid=1143757043"},

This investigation aims, in particular, to mark off the confidence Interval of neglecting free surface deformation hypothesis by comparing the results of static drift test with and without considering this assumption. The study was carried on a 135 m inland containership at a scale ratio of 1:25 undergoing static drift tests. In order to recreate the ship–bottom interaction, the depth to draft ratio (h/T) is varied to obtain four channel configurations. The tests are performed by numerical code under the commercial software Ansys Fluent by solving Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equations(RANSE) coupled to a $$k -\\omega$$SST turbulence model. To investigate the effect of free surface modelling, the hydrodynamic forces are compared when the free surface separating air and water is considered, using Volume Of Fluid (VOF) method, and when the free surface is neglected.

BLT is a subject of fluid flow disturbances created by geometric parameters and flow conditions, such as surface roughness, increased velocity, and high-pressure fluctuations, to name a few. These disturbances lead to the development of turbulent spots and differential heating. Historically, the Reynolds number has been used to predict whether a system will develop turbulent flow. However, it has been known for decades that it is not always reliable and cannot indicate where the BLT will occur: some experiments present scenarios where the flow is laminar at a high Reynolds number and vice versa. We can predict the BLT from performing physical experiments, but they are expensive and physical configurations are limited. Despite many community efforts and successes, no general computational solution to simulate different flows and vehicle types that fully incorporate BLT exists. Many are a considerable number of parameters that affect BLT. Therefore, we use Causal Inference to predict BLT by cause-and-effect analysis on multivariate data obtained from BLT studies. Data generated using high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with resolved Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) scales, will be analyzed for turbulence intensity by decomposing velocity in mean and fluctuations. In this paper, we will be discussing approaches on how we predict BLT scenarios using cause and effect relationships driven by causal inference analysis.","author":[{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Arturo"},{"family":"Terrazas","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Adansi","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Kotteda","given":"V M Krushnarao"},{"family":"Munoz","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Vinod"}],"citation-key":"rodriguezCausalInferenceAnalysis2021","DOI":"10.1115/FEDSM2021-61843","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,10]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Causal Inference Analysis to Find Relationships Found in Boundary-Layer Transition – Part I: Theoretical","title-short":"Causal Inference Analysis to Find Relationships Found in Boundary-Layer Transition – Part I","type":"book"},

  {"id":"rudakovicApplicationStandardMethods2017","abstract":"Proper estimation of roll damping moment is of paramount importance for adequate assessment of dynamic stability of ships. However, experimental data on roll damping of inland vessels are scarce and unreliable. Thus the applicability of classic Ikeda’s method and its simplified version on typical European inland vessels is investigated, with specific focus on eddy making component. It is found that the simplified Ikeda’s method, in comparison to the classic method, may considerably underestimate the eddy making component of damping of full hull forms, or even return negative values, although the block coefficient is within the limits of method applicability. Hence, the paper explores possibilities of adjusting the simplified Ikeda’s method in order to improve the observed shortcoming, as well as to extend its application to stability analysis of inland ships.","author":[{"family":"Rudaković","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"rudakovicApplicationStandardMethods2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"9","source":"Zotero","title":"On application of standard methods for roll damping prediction to inland vessels","type":"article-journal"},

This work compares and contrasts two approaches to this problem: (1) A black-box deep learning approach based on a new neural network architecture that can better handle varying wave conditions, and (2) a clear-box model based on updates to linear response amplitude operators via a Gaussian process regression. Both models are trained and evaluated on a dataset consisting of more than 15,000 30-minute-long motion observation windows from two research vessels at sea in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Three different hindcast weather services are used, including two models from the EU’s Copernicus system and NOAA’s WAVEWATCH III. The evaluation shows that a tradeoff exists between the formulations, with the black-box formulation offering higher accuracy and the cost of less transparency. The weather hindcast used has a small impact on the results, and the ability of both models to generalize predictions between near-sister ships is also encouraging for the practical application of these techniques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schirmann","given":"Matthew L."},{"family":"Gose","given":"James W."},{"family":"Collette","given":"Matthew D."}],"citation-key":"schirmannComparisonPhysicsinformedDatadriven2023","container-title":"Ocean Engineering","container-title-short":"Ocean Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2023.115608","ISSN":"0029-8018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,15]]},"page":"115608","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A comparison of physics-informed data-driven modeling architectures for ship motion predictions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823019923","volume":"286"},

This implies that the amplified response effect should also be evaluated for the second-order wave load in addition to the first-order wave load. By performing a nonlinear time domain dynamic analysis, the bridge dynamic responses from wind and wave loadings are obtained.

For various frames of ship maneuvering models, determining the parameters of the models is always a tedious task. System identification theory can be used to establish system mathematical models by the system’s input data and output data. In this paper, based on the analysis of ship hydrodynamics, a nonlinear model frame of ship maneuvering is established. System identification theory is employed to estimate the parameters of the model. An algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter theory is proposed to calculate the parameters. In order to gain the system’s input and output data, which is necessary for the parameters identification experiment, turning circle tests and Zig-zag tests are performed on shiphandling simulator and the initial data is collected. Based on the Fixed Interval Kalman Smoothing algorithm, a pre-processing algorithm is proposed to process the raw data of the tests. With this algorithm, the errors introduced during the measurement process are eliminated. Parameters identification experiments are designed to estimate the model parameters, and the ship maneuvering model parameters estimation algorithm is extended to modify the parameters being estimated. Then the model parameters and the ship maneuvering model are determined. Simulation validation was carried out to simulate the ship maneuverability. Comparisons have been made to the simulated data and measured data. The results show that the ship maneuvering model determined by our approach can seasonably reflect the actual motion of ship, and the parameter estimation procedure and algorithms are effective.","author":[{"family":"Shi","given":"C"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"D"},{"family":"Peng","given":"J"},{"family":"Shen","given":"C"}],"citation-key":"shiIdentificationShipManeuvering2009","container-title":"International Journal on Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"Identification of Ship Maneuvering Model Using Extended Kalman Filters","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

The research presented in this doctoral thesis aims at enhancing the predictability and control of these critical roll responses. The thesis presents a holistic framework for predicting and assessing the roll damping, which is a crucial parameter for predicting roll motions, based on a unique combination of full scale trials, model tests, semi-empirical methods and computational fluid dynamics. The framework is intended to be used from the early design stage and gradually improved until delivery of the ship and finally to provide input for decision support in the operation. The thesis also includes a demonstration of a new application for rudder control to be used for mitigation of parametric roll. This is performed by simulating real incidents that have occurred with PCTC’s in service. Simulations with rudder roll control show promising results and reveal that the approach could be very efficient for mitigation of parametric roll. Finally, an approach for monitoring of roll induced stresses, so-called racking stresses in PCTC’s, is presented. The approach involves measurement of the ship motions and scaling of pre-calculated structural responses from global finite element analysis. Based on full scale motion and stress measurements from a PCTC in-service the approach is evaluated and demonstrated to be an efficient alternative to conventional methods.","author":[{"family":"Söder","given":"C.-J."}],"citation-key":"soderControllingRollResponses2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"publisher":"KTH","title":"Controlling the Roll Responses of Volume Carriers","type":"document"},

For volume carriers the hull lift and bilge keel components are the dominating components and the estimation of these components in the original method are benchmarked and scrutinized. It is concluded that the speed dependence of the bilge keels damping is underestimated by the original method. This is partially explained by that Ikeda seems to have underestimated the lift force of the bilge keels in his analytical expressions. Correcting for this and taking account of the lift force-generated pressure on the hull surface gives overall better agreement with model tests. It is also concluded that the hull lift damping component is significantly overestimated with the original method. Non-viscid CFD is used to propose a new generic expression for estimating the lift coefficients for volume carriers which greatly improve the accuracy in comparison to model test results. With these improvements Ikeda’s method is revitalized and the applicability is extended to unconventional volume carriers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Söder","given":"Carl-Johan"},{"family":"Rosén","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Huss","given":"Mikael"}],"citation-key":"soderIkedaRevisited2019","container-title":"Journal of Marine Science and Technology","container-title-short":"J Mar Sci Technol","DOI":"10.1007/s00773-017-0497-z","ISSN":"1437-8213","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"306-316","source":"Springer Link","title":"Ikeda revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00773-017-0497-z","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"sternExperienceSIMMAN20082011","abstract":"The SIMMAN 2008 workshop was held in Copenhagen, Denmark in April 2008. The purpose of the workshop was to benchmark the prediction capabilities of different ship maneuvering simulation methods including systems- and CFD-based methods through systematic quantitative comparisons and validation against EFD data for tanker (KVLCC), container ship (KCS), and surface combatant (5415) hull form test cases. For the KVLCC test case, two stern shape variants named KVLCC1 and KVLCC2 giving different instability loops were included. Free model test data was compared with systems-based methods and CFD for specified free maneuvers. Some of the systems-based methods used provided PMM and CMT data, and two used CFD instead. CFD-based methods were used to simulate forced motions and were compared with PMM/CMT model test data. The submissions were blind in the sense that the benchmark model test data was not provided prior to the workshop, unless data was required as input to the simulation method. A total of 64 submissions were received for the free maneuver simulations, which included a wide range of the state-of-the-art methods in use today, such as PMM- and CMT-based methods, CFD based methods, system identification, neural network tools and various empirical methods. For the forced motion simulations a total of 16 submissions were received, comprising different CFD-based methods such as RANS, URANS, and DES. This paper gives an overview of hulls, model tests, test cases, submissions, comparison results as well as the most important observations and conclusions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Stern","given":"F."},{"family":"Agdraup","given":"K."},{"family":"Kim","given":"S.

  {"id":"thompsonDesigningCapsizeBeam1997","abstract":"The mechanics of ship capsize under steady and transient conditions is reviewed, focusing on recent applications of global geometrical techniques of nonlinear dynamics. These yield significant new ideas about capsize in waves and its generalization, the escape of a driven oscillator from a potential well. These ideas are robust against gross changes in the forms of the stiffness and damping functions. Fractal basin boundaries in phase and control space yield useful design criteria against transient capsize, which have been applied to real ships. Invariant manifolds are used to explain and predict the sudden loss of safe basin in the space of the starting conditions, and indeterminate resonant jumps to capsize. Further work is concerned with capsize suppression by heave-roll coupling; effects of parametric excitation; and capsize under a propagating wave front. After this historical review, the practical relevance of the results is assessed, and suggestions are made for a standardized transient testing procedure for hulls. A systematic formulation for rolling in beam waves, employing the effective gravitational field perpendicular to the wave surface and the Froude-Krilov assumption, allows the use of the calmwater GZ curve. With general stiffness and damping functions, dimensional analysis offers insights that are often overlooked: for example, the sustainable wave slope is always proportional to the angle of vanishing stability. A degree of quantification is provided by a design formula derived from the displacement magnification of linear resonance. This is validated by Melnikov theory and simulation. It predicts that under worst-case excitation we have: sustainable wave slope = 2ζθv, where θv is the angle of vanishing stability and ζ is a damping ratio appropriate for heavy roll. So in ocean waves of slope 0.5 (≈30°), a vessel with a θv of one radian needs a damping ratio of about 1/4. Implications for the design of hulls reveal counter-intuitive results: it is the distance of the potential barrier, not its height, that prevents escape or capsize. The formula helps to define a universal capsize diagram. New results on symmetry breaking are finally presented. These show that capsize studies of a symmetric unbiased vessel can give seriously unsafe results. The sustainable wave slope is so sensitive to a symmetry-breaking bias (due to wind or cargo imbalance) that a static heel of 2.5° can halve the sustainable slope over a wide range of sea states.

Specifically, the state space model associated with the first order Nomoto model is both observable and controllable. The state space model associated with the second order Nomoto model is also observable; however, it is controllable only if the effective sway time constant is different from the effective yaw time constant. The zero appearing in the transfer function model is found responsible for the overshoot behaviors, which are typical in the yaw rate for large rudder angle steering. This suggests that a second order Nomoto model is more appropriate if the overshoot feature is to be properly modeled. Both the first and second order Nomoto transfer function models are identifiable, with an ill-conditioning problem associated the latter. This makes the first order Nomoto model very popular in the adaptive autopilot applications. Model reduction for a fourth order transfer function ship model describing the sway-yaw-roll dynamics is conducted to reach the second order Nomoto model describing the sway-yaw dynamics and the first order Nomoto model describing the yaw dynamics itself, and the Bode plots for these models are given to show the changes in system frequency response caused by model simplification.

The calculation method is considered to be applicable to estimate not only steady horizontal forces and moment due to short waves acting on ships in maneuvering motion, but also maneuvering motion of ships in short waves by time simulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ueno","given":"M."},{"family":"Nimura","given":"T."},{"family":"Miyazaki","given":"H."},{"family":"Nonaka","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"uenoSteadyHorizontalForces2001a","container-title":"Practical Design of Ships and Other Floating Structures","DOI":"10.1016/B978-008043950-1/50085-5","editor":[{"family":"Wu","given":"You-Sheng"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Wei-Cheng"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Guo-Jun"}],"event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-08-043950-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"671-677","publisher":"Elsevier Science Ltd","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"- On Steady Horizontal Forces and Moment Due to Short Waves Acting On Ships in Manoeuvring Motion","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080439501500855"},
  {"id":"vanderkolkLowaspectRatioAppendages2021","abstract":"Wind propulsion for commercial ships has been identified as a key component in the energy transition for the maritime industry. The sailing hybrid ship will operate with leeway (drift) angles to produce a lateral force known as sideforce, for steady operation under sail. In this paper, experimental results for the sailing performance of ships fitted with bilge keel appendages are presented. Systematic variations in appendage height, length, and position were tested, including several special cases (multiple bilge keels). The appendage typology is shown to mitigate the strong ‘destabilizing’ yaw moment that is characteristic of wind-assisted commercial vessels and to promote the non-linear sideforce component. The working principal for bilge keels—promotion of flow separation—can be employed to specify the separation location for components of the vessel vortex wake to improve the sailing performance of the ship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kolk","given":"N.

Modern Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers can provide, not only the performance of the whole system but also an insight into the flow problem. In the present paper, an open-source viscous flow solver has been validated against available literature experimental measurements in different conditions. After an extensive analysis of the numerical influence of the mesh arrangement and the turbulent quantities on the rudder provided forces, the study focused its attention on the forces generated by the rudder varying the propeller loading conditions and the mutual position between the two devices. These analyses give a hint to describe and improve a commonly-used semi-empirical method based on the actuator disk theory. These analyses also demonstrate the ability of these numerical approaches to correctly predict the interaction behaviour in pre-stall conditions with quite reasonable computational requests (proper also for a design stage), giving additional information on the sectional forces distribution along the span-wise rudder direction, useful to further develop a new semi-empirical rudder model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Villa","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Franceschi","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Viviani","given":"Michele"}],"citation-key":"villaNumericalAnalysisRudder2020","container-title":"Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","DOI":"10.3390/jmse8120990","ISSN":"2077-1312","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"12","page":"990","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Numerical Analysis of the Rudder–Propeller Interaction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/8/12/990","volume":"8"},

A new system identification method for generating a low-speed maneuvering model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and free running model tests is proposed in this study. We especially focus on a low-speed maneuver such as the final phase in berthing to achieve automatic berthing control. Accurate dynamic modeling with minimum modeling error is highly desired to establish a model-based control system. We propose a new loss function that reduces the effect of the noise included in the training data. Besides, we revealed the following facts - an RNN that ignores the memory before a certain time improved the prediction accuracy compared with the \"standard\" RNN, and the random maneuver test was effective in obtaining an accurate berthing maneuver model. In addition, several low-speed free running model tests were performed for the scale model of the M.V. Esso Osaka.

However, creating an advanced model that comprehensively represents the system and its interaction with dynamic environments has always been challenging. Many models provide partial knowledge about a system. To handle the deﬁciency and improve model ﬁdelity, we propose a hybrid modeling methodology, in which prior knowledge describing the ship dynamic effects is incorporated into a data-driven calibrator, yielding a representative model with high predictive capability. Enabled by the integration of model estimated ship states into the calibrator, the informative information could be interpreted and carried forward. Simulation and full-scale experiments are conducted on the research vessel Gunnerus to exemplify the concept. A best available numerical model and a neural network are prepared to be the foundation and calibrator, respectively. Experiment results show that the cooperative model greatly improves the predictive capability of the research vessel.

  {"id":"wangUncertaintySensitivityAnalysis2023","abstract":"Model uncertainty is pervasive and inherent in the engineering field. It could bring potential risks in real applications, especially for ship behaviour prediction under environmental disturbances. The evaluation and quantification of model uncertainty are of importance for accurate ship motion prediction. This study applies model uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis methods to evaluate the ship motion model's level of uncertainty against environmental disturbances and ship manoeuvres. Firstly, three models are created based on the a dynamical model (Mariner) in Marine Systems Simulator. After that, models are tested on various predefined scenarios. The similarity of predicted tra-jectories and the reference is evaluated by Euclidean distance and used to quantify the uncertainty of models. Next, statistical analysis is used to analyze the uncertainty of models. Sensitivity analysis (SA) method called 'PAWN' and 'UnivariateSpline' interpolation technology are combined to identify which factors contribute the most to model's performance. The results suggest that the uncertainty caused by external factors varies from different models under different manoeuvres. SA can tell us which factors (wind angle, wind velocity, and surge speed) have a large influence to the model uncertainty given a ship maneuver. Such analyses, on the one hand, contribute operators to choosing the optimum model according to the current conditions for better ship motion prediction. On the other hand, they can pick up the most important factors for fast uncertainty modelling.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Chunlin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Tongtong"},{"family":"Nord","given":"Skjerve"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Houxiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Guoyuan"},{"family":"Osen","given":"Ottar"}],"citation-key":"wangUncertaintySensitivityAnalysis2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,4]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for the performance evaluation of ship dynamical model","type":"article-journal"},

However, a ship can rarely follow pre-defined speeds because dynamic sea environments lead to continuous speed variation. In this paper, a voyage optimization method is proposed to optimize ship engine power to reduce fuel and air emissions. It is a combination of dynamic programming and genetic algorithm to solve voyage planning in three-dimensions. In this method, the engine power is discretized into several levels. The potential benefit of using this algorithm is investigated by a medium-size chemical tanker. A ship’s actual sailing is used to demonstrate benefits of the proposed method. On average 3.4% of fuel-saving and emission reduction can be achieved than state-of-the-art deterministic methods. If compared with the actual full-scale measurements, on average 5.6% reduction of fuel consumption and GHG emis­ sions (about 275 tons) can be expected by the proposed method for the six case study voyages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Helong"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Mao","given":"Wengang"}],"citation-key":"wangVoyageOptimizationCombining2021","container-title":"Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment","container-title-short":"Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.trd.2020.102670","ISSN":"13619209","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","page":"102670","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Voyage optimization combining genetic algorithm and dynamic programming for fuel/emissions reduction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1361920920308555","volume":"90"},

To establish a vessel scheduling model, accurate ship maneuvering models should be used to optimize the strategy and maximize the economic beneﬁts. The use of nonparametric modeling techniques to identify ship maneuvering systems has attracted considerable attention. The Gaussian process has high precision and strong generalization ability in ﬁtting nonlinear functions and requires less training data, which is suitable for ship dynamic model identiﬁcation. Compared with other machine learning methods, the most obvious advantage of the Gaussian process is that it can provide the uncertainty of prediction. However, most studies on ship modeling and prediction do not consider the uncertainty propagation in Gaussian processes.

This predictability limit is studied using unprecedented high-resolution global models with ensemble experiments of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF; 9-km operational model) and identical-twin experiments of the U.S. Next-Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS; 3 km). Results suggest that the predictability limit for midlatitude weather may indeed exist and is intrinsic to the underlying dynamical system and instabilities even if the forecast model and the initial conditions are nearly perfect. Currently, a skillful forecast lead time of midlatitude instantaneous weather is around 10 days, which serves as the practical predictability limit. Reducing the current-day initial-condition uncertainty by an order of magnitude extends the deterministic forecast lead times of day-to-day weather by up to 5 days, with much less scope for improving prediction of small-scale phenomena like thunderstorms. Achieving this additional predictability limit can have enormous socioeconomic benefits but requires coordinated efforts by the entire community to design better numerical weather models, to improve observations, and to make better use of observations with advanced data assimilation and computing techniques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Fuqing"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Y.

  {"id":"zhuParameterIdentificationShip2017","abstract":"Determination of ship maneuvering models is a tough task of ship maneuverability prediction. Among several prime approaches of estimating ship maneuvering models, system identification combined with the full‐scale or free‐ running model test is preferred. In this contribution, real‐time system identification programs using recursive identification method, such as the recursive least square method (RLS), are exerted for on‐line identification of ship maneuvering models. However, this method seriously depends on the objects of study and initial values of identified parameters. To overcome this, an intelligent technology, i.e., support vector machines (SVM), is firstly used to estimate initial values of the identified parameters with finite samples. As real measured motion data of the Mariner class ship always involve noise from sensors and external disturbances, the zigzag simulation test data include a substantial quantity of Gaussian white noise. Wavelet method and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are used to filter the data corrupted by noise, respectively. The choice of the sample number for SVM to decide initial values of identified parameters is extensively discussed and analyzed. With de‐noised motion data as input‐output training samples, parameters of ship maneuvering models are estimated using RLS and SVM‐RLS, respectively. The comparison between identification results and true values of parameters demonstrates that both the identified ship maneuvering models from RLS and SVM‐RLS have reasonable agreements with simulated motions of the ship, and the increment of the sample for SVM positively affects the identification results. Furthermore, SVM‐RLS using data de‐noised by EMD shows the highest accuracy and best convergence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Man"},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Yuanqiao"},{"family":"Bolles","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"zhuParameterIdentificationShip2017","container-title":"TransNav, the International Journal on Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation","container-title-short":"TransNav","DOI":"10.12716/1001.11.01.01","ISSN":"2083-6473","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"23-29","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Parameter Identification of Ship Maneuvering Models Using Recursive Least Square Method Based on Support Vector Machines","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.transnav.eu/Article_Parameter_Identification_of_Ship_Zhu,41,694.html","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"zhuShipManoeuvringModel2022","abstract":"Due to the recent technological advancement into the ship digitalization and automation, there has been an increasing demand for more accurate determination of the ship mathematical model. In order to establish a more realistic ship manoeuvring model, it will be a vital task to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients while considering the effect of environmental disturbances, such as the wind. To account for the measurable wind perturbation which current research often neglects, in this paper, a deterministic model is constructed, based on which the SVM method is implemented to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients. The parameter identification is conducted on a 3-degree of freedom Abkowitz model using data collected from a sequential zigzag manoeuvre, and the results are verified against the benchmark value. The model performance is further validated by trajectory comparisons. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method in cases where the wind speed is less than 8m/s and the measurement noise is less than 13%.","author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Mingda"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Tongtong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Houxiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Guoyuan"}],"citation-key":"zhuShipManoeuvringModel2022","container-title":"2022 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR)","DOI":"10.1109/RCAR54675.2022.9872289","event-title":"2022 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"page":"648-653","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Ship manoeuvring model identification under wind disturbance","type":"paper-conference"},
