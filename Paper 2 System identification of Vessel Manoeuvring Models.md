In the 2nd paper – System identification of Vessel Manoeuvring Models [[@alexanderssonSystemIdentificationVessel2022]] – three major problems where addressed:
> [!Paper 1 to Paper 2]  
>> * Manoeuvring → Expand to 3DOF (three degrees of freedom).
>> * Handle noise → Find estimator for he higher order time derivatives – velocity and acceleration. 
>> * System identification → Find appropriate mathematical model → Identify paramerers.
