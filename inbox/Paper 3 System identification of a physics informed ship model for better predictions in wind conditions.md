[[multicollinearity]] and [[generalization]] are addressed in this paper.

System identification of a physics-informed (PI) and a -uninformed (PU) model is conducted with [[inverse dynamics]] (ID) regression. 
The physical correctness of the force prediction models is assessed with a "physically correct" reference model identified with [[virtual captive tests]].

It was investigated if the introduction of a deterministic [[semi-empirical rudder]] (see [[Paper 3 Semi-empirical rudder]]) model in the PI model would reduce the [[multicollinearity]] and enhance the [[generalization]].
The [[difference method]] and [[PCA]] are other ways to do this.

The use of perturbed velocity enables the possibility to have nonlinear resistance

## Conclusions
<mark class="hltr-green">"All identified models are mathematically correct since they predicted the model tests with satisfactory agreement.”</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GHSB3SIB?page=25&annotation=FUAEYJCH) 

<mark class="hltr-green">"While the total yawing moment is the same for all models, the decomposition of hull and rudder moments vary significantly”</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GHSB3SIB?page=20&annotation=H7IZ8UKN)

The #parameter-decomposition ([Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GHSB3SIB?page=23&annotation=QWD3AGFX)) seems to be a new way to visualize the model predictions.

<mark class="hltr-green">"Potential problems with the incorrect force decomposition of the PU model were shown in the lack of generalization of an artificial wind state, where the forces and moments had substantial errors.”</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GHSB3SIB?page=26&annotation=QCTYRQIP)

<mark class="hltr-green">"Introducing a semi-empirical rudder model seems to have guided the identification toward a more physically correct model, with lower multicollinearity and better generalization from calm water zigzag tests to wind conditions.”</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GHSB3SIB?page=26&annotation=X7TSJPRP)
