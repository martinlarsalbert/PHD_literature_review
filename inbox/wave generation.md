## CMT
The transverse force and yawing moment nondimensionalized by $u^2$ is different for 18 and 30 knots for both drift angles and circle tests.

 ## VCT
 There is poor agreement between the [[virtual captive tests|VCT]] and [[CMT]] for drift angles at high Froude number.

## Conclusions
* The difference between nondimensional forces for higher Froude numbers is most likely due to the free surface wave generation, which is not included in the double body VCT.
* The Froude number effect is not so large for smaller drift angles.
