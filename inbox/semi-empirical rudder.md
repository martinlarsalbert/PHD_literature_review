Well established semi-empirical formulas for the rudder lift $L_R$ and drag $D_R$ based on wind tunnel tests [[@whickerFreeStreamCharacteristicsFamily1958]].

The problem is how to model the inflow velocity $V_R$ and angle $\alpha_f$ in the wake of the ship hull. This is hard for straight ahead condition, but even harder when the ship also has a drift angle and yaw rate.
