* Paper submitted
* SeaMan model?
* 7m model experiments in after June (August realistically)
* PCA?
* Black box?
* Paper 4 title? "Design of experiments"

It was decided that I will attempt the SI with physics informed model on the existing 7m data. The [[difference method]], PCA, or black box methods could be attempted to mitigate the multicollinearity. 

If I cannot get a good model, this will be reported and methodology to conduct new experiments will be explored, considering the [[persistence of excitation]], something like [[@wangOptimalDesignExcitation2020]]. If new real experiments with the 7m model are conducted, this will be left for additional work in the thesis, outside paper 4.
