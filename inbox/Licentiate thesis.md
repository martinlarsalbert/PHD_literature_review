| <mark class="hltr-white">White</mark> | involves applying physical principles to ensure that no observed data is required. One example is computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Semi-empirical models, in which unknown physical constants have been derived from historical experiments, could also be considered white-box models [[@leifssonGreyboxModelingOcean2008]]. |
| <mark class="hltr-grey">Grey</mark>   | means that parameters do not have physical significance and that the objective is to find an effective model that fits the observed data [[@lindskogToolsSemiphysicalModelling1995]]                                                                                                                                             |
| <mark class="hltr-black">Black</mark> | is using a combination of white-box and black-box modeling methods to ensure that both a physical model and data are used. This concept is also referred to as semi-physical modeling, hybrid modeling, or semi-mechanistic modeling in the literature [[@leifssonGreyboxModelingOcean2008]]                                     |
