#CMT
## Drift angle
Comparison between captive model tests (CMT) with fins at the bilge (BK) and without it. It seems that yawing moment ${N_D}'$ increases more than ${Y_D}'$ with the fins.

## Heel
It seems that ${N_D}'$ was very different for the 5 degrees heeled case (with fins), while the transverse force ${Y_D}'$  was very similar. If the tests have been conducted correctly, this suggest that the force is the same – but the centre of effort has moved forward for the heeled case.

The largest roll angle is about 1.5 degrees for the wPCC during a zigzag20/20 – so much smaller than 5 degrees.

The roll angle for the turning circle is a bit smaller.

## Conclusions
1. The fin increases ${Y_D}'$  but also increases  ${N_D}'$ even more. This is a major difference between the MDL model and the 7m model.
2. It seems that the centre of effort moves forward when the ship heels so that  ${N_D}'$  is increased.
