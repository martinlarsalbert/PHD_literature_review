#generalization generality

It was discovered very soon that the problem of identifying parameters of a rather complex and realistic ship manoeuvring model is ==ill-posed== and at high noise levels typical for the sea trials data heavily biased estimates and, as result, useless models could be obtained. [[@abkowitzMEASUREMENTHYDRODYNAMICCHARACTERISTICS1980]] was only able to fight the observed cancellation effect through elimination of “inconvenient” terms which, however, could lead to models with limited applicability as certain regression terms may only become significant in special conditions ==like sailing in wind==.
