Here is my implementation of the [zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/).

>[!quote]
*A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.*

Niklas Luhmann "the godfather" of the Zettelkasten Method was a very productive researcher.
## Note types
#### Fleeting notes
quick, temporary, capture in the moment
#### Literature notes
*  I have a [[ZI_template]] which loads meta data for the papers including annotations and figures.

1. Read the paper in Zotero and make annotations
2. Import the paper with Zotero Integration: Ctrl + I 
3. The annotations are now stored in the "Annotations" section of the imported note Ex: [[@wangOptimalDesignExcitation2020]]
4. Summarize the paper in my own words – processing the annotations – in the Notes section ([[@wangOptimalDesignExcitation2020#Notes]]) (The area between %% begin notes %% and %% end notes %% is not overwritten if the paper is imported again.).
#### Permanent/Atomic notes : connected notes.
* One big idea per note
* Understandable without context
* Written in my own words

If many papers are talking about the same thing, I make a permanent note about it.

#### Reference notes
Table of contents and summaries etc. 

This is summarizing the literature study for the whole paper (see [[Paper 4]]).
