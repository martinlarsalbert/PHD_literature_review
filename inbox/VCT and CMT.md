#VCT
Made a comparison between the [[virtual captive tests|VCT]] (MDL scale) and captive model tests (CMT) (TT scale) for the wPCC. It seems that ${Y_D}'$ was very similar, but ${N_D}'$ was much larger for CMT.

Included CMT results with/without fins and compared with different VCT, where ==M5139-02-A_MS== is Kjellbergs calculations â€“ which were used in [[Paper 3 Semi-empirical rudder]]. I'm not sure where ==V2_3_R2_MDL== came from.
==M5139-02-A_MS== agrees better with CMT without fins (without BK) which is strange, since it should have the fins.
==V2_3_R2_MDL== has the best agreement with CMT with fins.

Is this due to wave generation or scale effects?
The wave generation influence is not so pronounced for smaller drift angles (see [[wave generation]]). The difference shown above can therefore not be explained by wave generation solely.
