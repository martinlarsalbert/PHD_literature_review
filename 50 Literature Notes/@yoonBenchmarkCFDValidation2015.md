> Part II of this two-part paper presents computational fluid dynamics (CFD) benchmark local flow field measurements for a surface combatant in dynamic planar-motion-mechanism (PMM) maneuvers. Phase-averaged stereoscopic particle-image-velocimetry (PIV) measurements are performed for pure sway and pure yaw maneuvers. The geometry is David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) model 5512, a 3.048m geosim of DTMB model 5415. The experiments are done in a 100m×3m×3m towing tank. The measurement system is a custom-designed towing tank maneuvering test flow-mapping system, which features a PMM for captive model testing with an integrated stereoscopic PIV. Statistical convergence error is defined and monitored by using the confidence intervals of the mean and variance. The quality of data is also assessed by following standard uncertainty assessment procedures. The present experimental data are cross-referenced with computational simulations for identification of the major vortices in the flow. The core locations and trajectories of the major vortices are traced and the flow variables at the core locations are analyzed. The tests of both Parts I and II are sufficiently documented and detailed to be useful as experimental benchmark data for validation of CFD codes. Part I presents the force/moment/motion measurements.
