> This thesis is an overview of added resistance in waves, available methods and how a simplified method
can be developed.
Added resistance in waves is indeed a very complicated problem. The present methods, most of them
developed during the 1970s, give reasonable results for head waves. But for quartering and following
waves, the methods have low accuracy, due to uncertainties in strip calculated ship motions for these
cases, and the ability to account for roll and yaw motions.
In this thesis Gerristma and Beukelman’s method and Boese’s method to calculate added resistance is
implemented and validated against published calculation results, from previous implementations. The
implementations are also evaluated against published experimental results in head waves. These
evaluations show that added resistance with good accuracy can be calculated for head waves using
Gerritsma and Beukelman’s method.
This thesis also shows how a simplified method to calculate added resistance in waves can be developed.
This simplified method only uses the ships main particulars to describe the hull. The method is intended
to be used when the entire hull geometry is not available, for instance in the pre-study of a new ship
design. The idea with this method is to estimate transfer functions for added resistance without using strip
calculations. The transfer functions are parameterized with three parameters, peak value, peak frequency
and spreading. Expressions for these parameters are derived with regression analysis, based on analytical
results from Gerritsma and Beukelman’s method. The simplified method has an accuracy of about 25%,
which is about the same amount that usually can be expected of a method to calculate added resistance in
waves.
