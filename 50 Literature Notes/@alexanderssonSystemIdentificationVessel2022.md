> Identifying the ship’s maneuvering dynamics can build models for ship maneuverability predictions with a wide range of useful applications. A majority of the publications in this ﬁeld are based on simulated data. In this paper model test data is used. The identiﬁcation process can be decomposed into ﬁnding a suitable Vessel Manoeuvring Model (VMM) for the hydrodynamic forces and to correctly handle errors from the measurement noise. A Parameter Identiﬁcation Technique (PIT) is proposed to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives. The most suitable VMM is found using the PIT with cross-validation on a set of competing VMMs. The PIT uses inverse dynamics regression and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with a Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother. Two case study vessels, wPCC and KVLCC2, with very diﬀerent maneuverability characteristics are used to demonstrate and validate the proposed method. Turning circle predictions with the Robust VMMs, trained on zigzag model tests, show good agreement with the corresponding model test results for both ships.
