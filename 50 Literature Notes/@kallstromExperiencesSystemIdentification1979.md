> [!Abstract]
>
> Different system identification methods have been applied to determine ship steering dynamics from full-scale e}~eriments. The techniques used include output error, maximum likelihood and more general prediction error methods. Different model structures have been investigated ranging from input-output models in difference equa.tion form to the equations of motion in their natural form. Effects of disturbances, errors and dynamics in sensors and actuators have been considered. Programs for interactive system identification have been used extensively. The experiments have been performed both under open loop and closed loop conditions. Both linear and nonlinear models have been considered. The paper summarizes the experiences obtained from applying system identification methods to many different ships. The results have been applied both to investigate steering properties and to design autopilots for ship steering. Insight into ship steering dynamics and identification methodology has been obtained.
