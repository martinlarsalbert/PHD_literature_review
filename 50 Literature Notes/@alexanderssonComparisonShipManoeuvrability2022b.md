> It is essential to describe a ship’s manoeuvrability for various applications, e.g. optimal control of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). In this study, the capability of two recognised manoeuvrability models to predict ships’ trajectories is investigated based on both simulation and open-water experiment test data. The parameters of these models are estimated by a statistical learning method. The goodness of the two estimated models for describing a merchant ship’s manoeuvrability is first studied using her manoeuvring simulation data. Then, experimental manoeuvring tests to use a USV in open water with wind and drifting effects are used to check the conventional model identification procedures. Finally, some modifications and adjustments are proposed to improve the conventional procedures. It shows that the proposed procedures can accurately derive the ship’s manoeuvrability based on experimental data.
