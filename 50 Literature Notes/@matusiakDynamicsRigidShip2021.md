> [!Abstract]
>
> In the first part, theoretical background and mathematical models making up an entity capable to describe ship non-linear behavior in sea waves combined with the maneuvering are presented. Numerical implementation of the models, in a form of LaiDyn computer program, is discussed. Internal loads acting on a rigid hull girder in waves including the non-linear effects are discussed. Also the effect of hull flexibility on the girder internal loads and response to wave loading is reviewed.
Second part discusses validation of the mathematical model and presents particular applications of the method.
