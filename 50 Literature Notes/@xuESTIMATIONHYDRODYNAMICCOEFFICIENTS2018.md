> [!Abstract]
>
> Free-running model tests have been carried out based on a scaled chemical tanker ship model, having a guidance, control and navigation system developed and implemented in LabVIEW. In order to make the modelling more flexible and physically more realistic, a modified version of Abkowitz model was introduced. During the identification process, the modelâ€™s structure is fixed and its parameters have been obtained using system identification. A global optimization algorithm has been used to search the optimum values and minimize the loss functions. In order to reduce the effect of noise in the variables, different loss functions considering the empirical errors and generalization performance have been defined and implemented in the system identification program. The hydrodynamic coefficients have been identified based on the manoeuvring test data of free-running ship model. Validations of the system identification algorithm were also carried out and the comparisons with experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system identification method.
